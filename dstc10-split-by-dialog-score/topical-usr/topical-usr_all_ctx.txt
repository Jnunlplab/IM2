so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke   i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award   yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their " home grown " market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .   i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to   sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?

i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team ,   what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team .   well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach   john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ?   oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ?   football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him .   maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ?

hello   hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days .   that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet .   what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players .   i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along .   what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down .   that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go .   i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans .   oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick .   i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true .   i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver .   women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ?   this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage .   belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .

hi there , how 's it going ?   it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ?   oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore .   baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact .   yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ?   i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games .   yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ?   162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something .   yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ?   the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 .   yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics   i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball .   yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us " run to fourth ! " and we were like , " you mean home ? run home ? "   baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect " rounders " cards the way we collect baseball cards .   right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer .   some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money .   yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .   thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out .

hi ! do you follow football ?   sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it .   that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia .   i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ?   yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then .   now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype .   he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too .   do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university .   i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway   i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play .   it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis .   i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works .   i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder .   do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .   i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .   it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end .

have you heard of doug harey ?   was n't he an umpire for the mlb ?   yes he just died at 87 years of age .   i guess he was a big deal , and he lived quite a while . he 'll be missed though   he must 've been an interesting character to earn the nick name ' god ' .   he was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing   yup , he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games .   and five world series , which is a big leagues in the mlb . he was n't intimidated by anyone , it seems   he was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903 .   that 's incredible ! do you pay attention to baseball much ?   no i did when i was younger but lost interest . how bout you ?   every once in a while . it 's one of those sports i would rather play than watch . the japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name " national pastime " from the americans if they could   yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too .   enough that people used to collect baseball cards . one man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars   that s a lot of money . are any managers cards worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all .

the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ?   i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n’t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice .   well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently .   i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i ’m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house .   like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson .   though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though .   i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .   what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's   they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .

hi there ! looking forward to chat with you ! ;)   hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising .   does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ?   i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising !   actress ? i wonder how she did that ...   pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !   probably some celebrity bought it ;) regular person would n't be able to afford it ;)

did you see crazy rich asians ?   no i have n't . i heard it was good .   i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy .   my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ?   it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background .   if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director .   yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film .   the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 .   that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .   well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life .   i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat .   this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us .   that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ?   it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth .   i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long .   i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .   i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .

hello , did you know that more than 80 % of the earths forests have been destroyed ?   that is sad . i hope we can reverse that statistic .   yeah that is really sad . i recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century .   i also think it is interesting that when earth was formed , a day was only 5.5 hours long . i wonder why that changed ?   i do n't know , maybe it slowed its rotation eventually ? that 's pretty weird .

so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke   i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award   yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their " home grown " market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out .   i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to   sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ?   i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ?   a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting ..   there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence   you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? )   that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though .   it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music !   i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii   wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those " eccentric rock and roll musician " things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...   it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters   well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ?   now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit

hey are you aware of banned books week ?   i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ?   i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood   are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status   yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ?   not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books   well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me   true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years   i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol   considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips   i think so . what do you think about the norway government though ? if you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country   i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book   well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol   children 's books require less writing and more illustrations . it would be worth it for the extra 500 copies though   haha i agree with you . do you ever buy stuff from amazon ? do you know why jeff bezos put a clock into a mountain lol
