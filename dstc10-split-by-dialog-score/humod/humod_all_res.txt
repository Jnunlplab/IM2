Forget it.
Shhhh.
Let me see what I can do.
As many times as it takes.
Where?
I love you.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
It's a surprise.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Or both.
Tons
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
You always been this selfish?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Let's go.
You need a new car anyway.
I hope so.
Junior!
They do not!
Shut up and let me think.
You might wanna think about it
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Joey.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Expensive?
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
See you, Bob.
So did you
Thank you.  Benjamin --
No! I just wanted
I love you, too.
Exactly my point
Perhaps.
It's just a party. Daddy.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Just for a minute
Doc.
Because she'll scare them away.
Thirty seconds.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Because we're going there.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Apparently so.
You wanna go out with him?
I got your card.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Everything but the boring parts.
Then, go get her
I'm in charge. We go back!
You get the girl.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Not at all
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Fine, thirty.
No.
Get her to act like a human
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
We're not.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
You seem...nervous.
Oh, right.  Friday.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That's what I want to know.
I'm fine. I'm
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
What?
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
This.
You mean...?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
I'm gettin' there
Sure, right.
Maybe.
Always keep 'em laughing.
For. . . ?
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Yes.
No, I won't go with you
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Why not?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I didn't care about the money.
Of course!
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Yeah.  I guess.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Oh yeah.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Good enough.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Dr. Ruth?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
That ' s what I thought
Where he always is.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Have you got transport?
We'll all go crazy...
It's his life insurance money, you know.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Jack ...
Are we going to argue?
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Thank God...
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I'll wait.
I am busy inside.
Jack.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I'm looking for potential.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No. Look. There.
Call them.
No. No.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
David, let's go now.
Why?
Now. We close now.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
The big one.
Ask him if he will help.
I don't know. Oh.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Go?
How long?
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Well?
My horse doesn't work.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Can I see your back?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
They won't until this is over.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
Somewhere else?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Yeah.  This way.
I don't know.
Right.
Of course.
I'll get my clothes.
You may use my office.
Daphne, I...
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
You're my brave boy.
Okay.  But not water sports.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
You ready?
My mother?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
The pleasure is mine.
No.  I'm okay.
Tell your mother.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Yeah.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Better than one.
Jim Younger, I told you--
Is that all there is?
Here, take my jacket.
Something back home?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Raw deal.
Run, stupid!
Just a shower?
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Okay.
Oh, Rick!
Alright.
Of course!
Alright.
They did not!
Hey.
Goodnight.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Again.  Try again.
Not what.  Who.
I think everything is okay.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Well?
Yes sir.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
I don't see how.
Okay.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Don't want to film this?
Passion.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Still drawing a blank.
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
I don't hear no fat lady.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Yes I do.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Go.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
I ain't in a hurry.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
You're crazy.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Ass!
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Delicious.
Not good.
No, but I certainly shall.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well, this explains the music.
She's wonderful.
Just do it.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
I don't think so.
You are frightened, no?
What.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Okay, come on down.
You know who I am.
Yes.
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Roger.
OK.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Let's get a hot dog.
We have to call the ambulance.
Right here.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
You must have been dreaming.
No, I can't tell you!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
In three days, darling, I hope.
What, sir?
When are you coming home?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Goodbye, Daddy.
What I've seen... I've liked.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Well, how's it going back there?
Can't you?
I want to pick up my car.
Been there, done that.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
He's alive.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
What's the matter with my place?
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
Here's hoping, baby...
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I would have done the same thing.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Oh, come off it, man.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
Okay. Okay.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
That's right.
Bullshit.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Twelve thousand.
Want to try it again?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
What?
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
I lied. Wait for it...
Come on.
Good, let's drink up.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
No way...
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
Hello. And goodbye.
No. I'll try again later.
What about Ganz?
I manage them.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Look, I just better go.
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Tell her what?
Don't worry about it.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
The sound again?
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
You couldn't get to him?
I'll be around.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Always keep 'em laughing.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Tell me about it.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
It won't work.
What?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
That what he says. Right?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
That's the way I see it, too.
You got the keys to the shop?
What's wrong with that?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Yes there is.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
He's great, right. Is he great?
Guess people ought to know who I am...
What's your real name?
So am I.
Please put it down.
Jack?  What was that?
I want you to calm down.
Fuck you.
...hundred yards further down the road.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Down boy.
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Okay, baby.
That's what I always say.
Missed you too, cousin.
That's no bull.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Shut up.
I would have done the same thing.
What do you want?
Anything... may I sit down?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Hello.
Sure, right.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
No you didn't.
First, the money.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Not bad, not bad.
No.  I don't.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
This ain't a credit business.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Five.  On credit.
I'll see ya around, huh?
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Yeah?
I'm fucked!
I think so.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Radio said.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You were too far behind.
Yes..thank God..
Nice.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Aye, sir.
Yes. Of course..
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Perfect.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
They are... with me...
Yeah, what?
Hey bud! Finger here.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
...Not yet.
No I wasn't...
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
-- I like the car I have.
This is a police control action..
Not luck. They don't want me.
Found it?
Huh?
Does it get any better or what!
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
No... Here he comes.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Frozen.
It's difficult.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Protect life... Until death.
She fucked me too.
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Fuck it! Hold tight!
You're welcome..
Good-bye!
How much time is left?
We're not going anywhere.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Well, thank you anyway.
Do you know how much I missed you?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
I love you.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
No way...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Tell me about it.
Tom...
Fourteen hundred.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I don't know. Nothing.
Tom... she's dead.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I just talked to her.
Yeah...before your time.
What can I do for you today?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Where we going?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Fuck off.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Who?
Right here.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
They should be here any minute.
It might have.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Fuck off.
No, don't say anything else!
You betrayed us.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Because we're going there.
Just because.
Fuck you.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
You'll get it when we get there.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Good for you.
Yes.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Aye, sir.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
Merrick...
Nope.
Yeah?
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Of course.
Just a shower?
Okay.
Young man, stop right there!
Yes.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Okay.  Fine.
BREAKING OUT
Kristen...
I'm part of the game, just like you.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Okay?
You could do worse.
I see a car.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Hello, glad to meet you.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Can't you do something?
"In her dream"?
Edward Bloom.
Three days.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
No. Answer it!
It's okay, we're just about there.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Alice?
Save it for later.  Come on!
Then it's worth the journey.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Nothin'.
Let me talk to you.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Oh God!  He killed them!
Don't tell me I can't --
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You're not taking my baby!
Good day.
Huh?
I'd give you a very good price.
Been having bad dreams.
We got it. We got it.
No...
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Who said I...wait, what?
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, babe.
Who would do such a thing?
I know.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Me too.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
There you go.  Love you.
I don't hear no fat lady.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
To take a picture.
There was no ad in the Times.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Now.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
But then when will we see each other?
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
It's right there on your golf bag.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Eh? In here!
That's the only reason you're alive...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
So did Dan.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
He's a good man.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
The pleasure is mine.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Not right now.
Mark!
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Nobody thinks that.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
What? Why am I bad?
That's their problem.
Yeah.
No shit.
Jackie.
I want to talk about the baby.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
He invited me to his house last night.
It's coming.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
At the end of the bar.
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
There you go.  Love you.
Listen!  Hear that?
Sorry to disappoint you.
The sound again?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Give me a drag.
Come where?
Thanks.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
So, what are you seeing?
I'll be another!
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Why don't you try?
Yes.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Something back home?
Oh.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Okay, let's go home, then.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Okay.
Fourteen hundred.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Go!!!
Wade.
You bet.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
She knows how to take care of herself.
She's coming.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Yeah.
You and me.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Yeah.
Look at me...
Bang!
Italian?
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Let's see it.
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
I went out.
Daddy...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Been better, Dad... You?
Oh my God oh my God...
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
He's busy being dead.
Go and look for a note.
I'm doing what I can.
I got a new deal for you.
To swear you in as President.
A beer.  Of course.
Any of us?
Marge, you like everybody.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm sorry. It is.
Come on, Alice.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Yeah...
Three...
Shit.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Not bad, not bad.
Good. Good.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Hold on, Alice.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Yes, sir.
He wouldn't move.
That isn't necessary.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Shhhh.
I wish it were that easy...
What did you say?
Please... don't start with me.
I just gotta see a guy.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Since you've had sex?
White House Situation room.
BLAME...
We're handling it, sir.
Good.
Two... THREE. GO!
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Right, right.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
What do you mean by that?
I just wish it was that simple.
Will I see you again?
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
I never tried it.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Ted!
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Oh...I can't. Business.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Two years.
Simon, what are you saying?!
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
JUST DO IT!
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
I can't tell.
What can I do for you today?
He had fish.
We have met ...
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
And a little ice!
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
The gear is down.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
How shall I do it?
Every day.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
Good-bye, darling.
Real rain?
Good-bye, darling.
Who made you do this?
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I said good call.
Here.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
Of course.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Yes, sir.
No. No thank you.
You have to tell me --
Yeah...
The cheese...
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Yes.
Show me.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Do it!
We've found all of them.
At the end of the bar.
I'm calling Gary.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
You will.
Stop the car!
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
They're all assholes.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Yes, sir.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
Good.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
But you're OK?
But there's no more drug.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
You look very good.
Yeah, what?
Did he find anything?
And I...I've got other things happening.
Whatever gave you that idea?
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
What's your real name?
See you soon.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Well, thanks, I --
Excuse me?
Sorry to disappoint you.
Be careful.
Proceed inside.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
They're but off!  Do something!
Let's say today, we make it your business.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Thanks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Do it!
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Let's get these things lit.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Fuckin' A!
No... don't hit me please...
On my way.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
You promised.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Oh.
Stand back.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Don't be long, Ellen.
It's not.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Uh, what's next?
I don't know... but it does.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
It's readin' right.  Look!
I guess I did.
No.. I've slept enough.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Did one of those things grow inside her?
The stairs from the street.
I know, honey.  Me too.
No.
Look!
Okay, come on down.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Perhaps.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
I'm so relieved.
Careful...
Why?
No.  She told me right now.
Oh, damn!
Oh, come off it, man.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Drop that fucking money!
Why?
No shit.
It's killing me.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Madame. How can I help you?
I don't know, Cole.
Isn't it obvious?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
She grew up.
What do you mean?
What yard? When who-
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
I... I don't remember.
In three months! Papa.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Be careful!
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Adorable!
Make it so.
Hey!
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
He's seriously disturbed...
I think so, Sire, yes.
Like...
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
He's busy being dead.
You don't have secrets from me.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Why didn't you tell me?
This is just a game, Papa.
That's not what's important.
Mine?
Oh, damn!
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
In there, sir.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
We don't know. West is dead.
I liked the horse.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
But this is absurd!
Yes..thank God..
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Yes, sir.
What man?
You were never late before, I was worried.
He knows. He knows!
Right.
Common time.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
But I...
Just let me tell you how it begins.
What about you?
Certainly, Herr Director.
Okay.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Really?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Here it is.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Italian?
Yeah.
You must be mad.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Tea would be nice.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
A wolf.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Right.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Will you give me a break?
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Truly.
A werewolf?
Twelve thousand.
Very nice.
Something I heard someone say once.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
What man?
The bedroom.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
There is only one bed.
Yes.  They're free.
It's nice to see you.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Good.
Roger.
Pull over.
She's a little sad, is all.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Well, I'll see ya.
Will you shut up!?!!
Okay.
David, let's go now.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
No.
Take a letter...
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
John: John:...my daughter...
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
No. You've had your chance.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
You could have told them!
Not much.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
We're not.
Good.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
And your husband works for somebody else.
Look at that.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
You ask them.
Don't want to film this?
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Not really.
Apparently so.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
What was it?
Till then.
Let's just keep walking.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Do you think it's a dog?
Right here. At the door.
No.
Okay.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
It'll spoil our supper.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
That's no bull.
Hi, David.
Yeah, come on.
How shall I do it?
I hope so.
No.
I sure don't hate you.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I just talked to her.
Oh.
It's okay.
You here again? What do you want?
Really want to know?
I want to know why .
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Yeah?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Charlie!
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Yeah.
Really?
Yes, sir.
You're for real?
And tell him not to delay.
Oh, sure!
We'll discuss that in the board room.
Vodka!
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Okay, Matt.
Why, I needed a
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What are you doing here?
Of course. I would like to look.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Who's your friend?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Yes there is.
Hello, darling.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
I was eight.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Right.
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Right.
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
Yes, sir.
It's okay. It's okay.
There you are.
I'll get a coat for her.
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
You still in love?
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Don't you think I know it?
We got it. We got it.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Perhaps.
Come here, honey!
Some kinds of women are...
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
You stay out of this, Bob.
Yes.
Maybe.
Oh, Matt.
Yes you can, Robin.
Yeah.
I wonder.
I tell you, I saw them!
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
All right, dear.
Better than one.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Yes.
Would of been nice.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
Then where were you?
The stairs from the street.
Okay, Matt.
Really?
You've got enough?
Now.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
No way... when?
Jim Younger, I told you--
Will I see you again?
Never a good thing.
I hope not.
That was two hours ago.
Oh. That.
You stay out of this, Bob.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Me too.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Her or me?
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Then I love it.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Exactly.
I'll get him.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Don't worry.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
I can't.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
Shut up.  West's dead.
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
No.  It didn't.
I got three.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
What will be?
Thanks.
A trap.
I'm sorry. It is.
Missed you too, cousin.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
The brown one.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Cole, he didn't mean that.
They go.
This here is the Younger Gang!
How much longer is this gonna last?
Shit.
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
I think he's already feeling better.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Maybe, maybe...
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
We're gonna have to talk...
I'm telling you, they changed it!
No, I --
Okay...
Everything but the boring parts.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
Boys?
I just wish it was that simple.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
At being a fake.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Yes ma'am.
Name it.
Don't swear.
Great. You can go in my place.
Pity.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
No.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Then let us prepare.
By burning down their homes?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Move you fools!
Bob! Get back in position!
What is going on here, man?
I know. I'm sorry.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
I look forward to seeing it.
Home.
What, sir?
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I remember you.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
No.
Absolutely not.
Turn the light on.
Could you be a little more specific?
Nothing.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Would you like to see my apartment?
You can't do that.
Do you take American Express?
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
Alright.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
It's not that nice.
This.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Thanks.
There was no ad in the Times.
Mr. Gardiner...
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Now what?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Where is she?
I won't...don't worry.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
The message you left.
At your house.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
All? It ain't bad.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Good, let's drink up.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Thank you.
This.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
See you then.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
That's the way I see it, too.
Can you bring Mr...
Okay, Matt.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Don't you threaten me!
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Do as I tell you!
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Yeah. But enough about me.
She's from...France.
How did you see us kiss?
You seem...nervous.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
I know. I'm sorry.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
No problem.
You mean the snake.
Well...
Come here a minute.
I'm so hungry.
The pleasure is mine.
I can paint anywhere.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
We're not gonna let it.
As many times as it takes.
Milo! What about --?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
It was a hate crime.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
...Different?
Okay.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
I am about this.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Great.
Don't be cruel.
Have a seat.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
The sound again?
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
That'd be good, Lula.
You're making me young again.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Right... Right.
Yeah. But enough about me.
Sure.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I'm going to California with my brother.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
That's correct. Look at me.
I mean, it's your life.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I'm calling Gary.
It's too neat.
Where we going?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
No. Please.
I'll walk back.
Let's try #2.
Don't know much, do you?
Yeah, yeah.
Because I'm going to get my father!
You're not listening.
What's your real name?
We're too late. Take a look.
But if it does.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Thanks a lot.
Yes?
In general.
Be careful.
What happened?? Where are we?!
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Get anything?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
You knew my Jody?
Go! Just go!
I wish I could.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Hey, wait a minute--
Run, stupid!
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
They should be here any minute.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
You didn't...
Maybe we should bail?
I love you, Vanessa.
I don't know.
... death ...
Let me go.
... power ...
Fire.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I'll pay for it.
Eh? In here!
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
We have met ...
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Next assignment?
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Yes indeed. I need protection.
No kidding?
Do you really think so?
Don't count it.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Nothing personal.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Do you know how much I missed you?
I'm playing to win.
On a ride.
As far as you trust me.
That's a damn long time...
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
...man!
You'll find out.
Five.  On credit.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry, he's expecting you.
You scared me.
You didn't tell her?
Okay.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Thanks.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Stay by the window. By the window.
Great.  Really.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Listen to me John.
...Really?
You are?!
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
You're kidding.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Women!
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
What?
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
We're not.
When do the girls get to the party?
Don't be cruel.
Bond... James Bond.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
See if these two are my friends.
Shit!
Just don't ask me no more shit.
She's mine!
Water.  Okay.
Sure have...
Come here, honey!
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
James...
Oh... I got something for that.
I was eight.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
I'll get it.
You're really pissing me off.
You look nervous.
I love you.
Apple core?
I am committed. I love you.
Pull over.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Frank.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Sure.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Hi.
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Come on.
Good.
I'd be you.
Oh, no!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Does she have room for me?
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
The best table in the house.
Fine.
Still drawing a blank.
I'll walk back.
Take care.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Who's your friend?
Oh...
I'll stop him... You stall him.
The bedroom.
What's with her costume?
Humans.
You got it.
Eh? In here!
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Be gentle.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
He's alive.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
Do it!
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
How about White?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Hey.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Goodnight.
So hello.
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
The engine is still running.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
I'll do it.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Just take it.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
You're right.
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
It's a small town.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
I'll see ya around, huh?
What's his name?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Okay...
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
The stairs from the street.
What are you listening to?
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Fire.
Right, right.
You look like... Brian.
Early July.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Yeah.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yes.
What the hell are we waiting for?
In my room.
Well, let's have a look.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Here we go...
I don't see how.
-- Burn it all.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Okay.  Fine.
No Marty, I don't.
You're a fool.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
You mean you could use it.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
I...
How 'bout...
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm on it.
Be careful!
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Well, I'm sold.
Why are you smiling so?
You are , aren't you?
Must be the pressure.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Look at my lips.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Different.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Of course.
Where do I sign?
Where's Connell?
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Your father is proud of you.
What yard? When who-
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Don't say a .
The big one.
Do you know where I'm going?
Break a leg.
No thanks.
Just don't lie to me.
Just now... I went with Seymour.
The pleasure is mine.
That I'm a freak.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What?  What, that guy?
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
Nah, I got the gun.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
Yes... I... yes.
That's why it will be so much fun.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
Work related or otherwise?
All right.
Give me the gun.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
They do not!
A song a comin' I feel.
Better than one.
Enough.
You were seeing someone, too.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
My people love me.
Believe me I know.
Then you must get it.
OK.
What is to be done?
No, you won't.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
I'm -- I'm sorry...
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Fine.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
I can explain.
Can anybody hear me!
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
I don't know!
Will you kiss me!
Shut up, Mueller.
What is to be done?
We don't know. West is dead.
That's so weird...
We found him like this...
But --
Shut up.  West's dead.
Oh, come off it, man.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Good for you.
They're dead, aren't they?
No. No thank you.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Do you take American Express?
Of course --
I wish he had a family, though.
You wanna bet?
Don't be cruel.
We've found all of them.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
We were just riding around.
The creek bed --
Let's get moving with this net.
Your weapons, Sergeant.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
I...
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
What do you want from me?
Do I?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Yeah...
Get out!
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
Who says something's on my mind.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Do ya?
I didn't do anything --
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Excuse me?
Tell me what I can do.
Listen to me I --
What about the confession?
Bobby.
The Senator...
Well, I'm sold.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
I'll be long gone.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
I don't wanna go.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I love you, Vanessa.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
You'll find out.
Got it.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
I lied. Wait for it...
-- I like the car I have.
Nah.
Right.
Get in.
Then you better start swimming.
Right back where we started.
Very nice.
Seven.
Jack?  What was that?
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
What?
Want company?
Did they have any explanation for this?
Nah.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Very well, then.
He wanted more than that.
Not what.  Who.
What.
Do I?
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
What the fuck are you doing?
Numbers? No, never mind.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
We're not going anywhere.
There was no ad in the Times.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Don't count it.
No --
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
It's too neat.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
In New York?
That's great.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Edward Bloom.
Hi.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
You wife isn't dead is she?
It truly is.
Will you give me a break?
I don't expect to.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Fine, I'm doing it.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Fine, you do it.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Let's see it.
By all means.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Or both.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
God have mercy on my soul.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
I can get it. I can just...
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Okay.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
I'm taking you back.
Okay.
Hi, Lenny.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You haven't even heard from him?
I'm not scared.
Of course, I do.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Can we talk?
I remember you.
The river?
Sure I'm sure!
How I go.
What the hell is going on?
Okay. Okay.
Sure.
Yes. Exactly.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Go out with me.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
I'll help you.
That's their problem.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Nope.
I'm going with you.
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Yes. Thank you.
Her or me?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
That was two hours ago.
There's over eighty thousand here.
So long.
We'll stop then.
On my way.
Yes.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Yeah.
"King Kong". It's really good.
Thank you.
Okay.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Name it.
I speak English.
No I haven't.
Let's not talk about that now.
Right.
That's good.
What are you doing here?
We are?
What?
I can't afford to get caught.
He says he feels safe here.
I got your card.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
What?
No.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Then you must get it.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Right. Okay. Good.
All right.
Sorry?
I don't know.
They go.
Kiss me.
Yes.
I don't know, didn't he call?
I don't have any money.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
I said I don't have any.
Is there. Is all there.
But, you know, so what?
What about Ganz?
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Okay we won't talk about it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
No.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
You don't understand you either.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Get out.
Won't you join us?
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
No, you won't.
I wasn't saying anything.
Turn left ahead.
Not really. Maybe a little.
No.  What house you work?
Are you scared?
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
She's alive?
Sure.
Laugh it up.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
I don't want anyone to die.
Thank you, Harry.
Because it was a lie.
Yes?
Goodbye.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Tell me about it.
See you, Bob.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
Cash.
Ghosts.
Yes, ma'am.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Then start taking them seriously.
It's a surprise.
Oh, she older than that.
Then let us prepare.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
You gonna miss your bus.
Pull over.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Yeah.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Come on, gal...
Here we go...
Wait. He left.
Come on.
Or what?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Whose doin' is that?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Sure.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
To freedom.
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
No joke.
Why?
I ain't in a hurry.
Shut up, Mueller.
Anything.
Grandma Death.
The... chain helps.
He's a fucking maniac!
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
I take out the garbage.
I tried.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Nothin'.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
I guess you have.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Maybe I won't.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Like I told you.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Daddy, it's true.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Yeah, I do.
No thank you.
Thanks.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Home.
He's not going to listen to me.
Let go...
More than that.
What?
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Right.
No.
Why, I needed a
Number five with a bullet.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
In Rome, I'll bow.
Yes.
I said let's go, Charlie.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
I hope not.
Nobody asked you to.
Maybe we should bail?
Where have they gone?
I don't think he'd feel it.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
I'm not gay.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Next of kin!
What's the problem here?
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
What shall we call him?
I'll get him for you, Nick.
Nothing.
I stole them.
Right.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
We'll all go crazy...
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Lower me down.
You were too far behind.
Do you?
You can trust me.
That I really don't know.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
NO!
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
I can't...
Course he has. That's his wife.
Me too.
Luck.
Luck.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Call for help.
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
He gets as much as he wants.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I'm not gay.
You met her.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
The cheese...
It's our goddamn car!
I'd like that.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
I'm taking you back.
We're here.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Can't you?
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
No thanks.
Anywhere.
Why not?
Come here.
What sheets?
I am?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Like...
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Thank you.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
They're all assholes.
Tomorrow, he says.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Hello, glad to meet you.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Right.
You didn't like her!?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Vodka!
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Shot of vodka, please.
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Thank you very much.
If I make it through the day.
No problem.
Yes, I am rather.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
No thanks.
You're not crazy.
I don't know.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
I'm taking a piss.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
But if you could?
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Of course.
Thank you.
You mean the snake.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Come on.
How about both of us at the same time?
And who do I go to about you?
Not here... alone.  Please.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
I'm sorry.
Dinner at the White House.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Yeah.
Right.
Okay...
Sit.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I won't...don't worry.
Oh.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Not too good.
Sorry.
I wish I could.
Why is that?
That's another thing I can't do.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Just wait here.
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
The machine works.  She is.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Thirteen.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Sorry.
Railroad tickets.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
White House Situation room.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
No time.
Oh.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
We sure did.
It won't work.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Oh, sure!
You scared me.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Thanks.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Good.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
You're all so perfect.
Bob!
Sure.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Yes, ma'am.
Goodnight.
Young man, stop right there!
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
I...
Do ya?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
No, you get out of here.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Now look at him...
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Heck, no!  What?!
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Right.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Okay!  Damn!
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
You didn't tell her?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
What's fair?
Won't I ever see you again?
Sure.
To run late!
What?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Sorry.
You're for real?
Night!
Any of us?
Thank you.
Just five or six people.
The engine is still running.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Sorry!
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
I was wrong!!
Okay.
Is this your house?
Come where?
Yes!
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
So, what are you seeing?
Come here, honey!
Good-bye!
I'm not, I'm very happy.
And don't be so obvious!
There's a few of us left.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
I'm sorry.
Call them.
Eve, I'm sorry.
I will.
Thanks.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
No.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
It's just a party. Daddy.
Nothing.
Hello, can you hear me now?
Of course!
She can't talk to you right now.
No kidding!
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Really?  Since when?
Then we'll never make it.
Okay.
BREAKING OUT
I LOVE THIS!!
How long ago was it?
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
I didn't have any choice.
Goodbye.
Yeah.
Just look!!
Only one you've never broken.
I don't see anything!
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Hi.
Oh, come off it, man.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
You're my brave boy.
How about White?
Mom?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Good.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
That's important.
Yes.
I don't know.
All our friends...
Maybe she's asleep.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Honey?
I'm so hungry.
What shall we call him?
Just my luck.
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
What?
We're falling behind.
Hi.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
And I made these!
A present I picked up for you.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
It certainly is.
Sure.
Outside!
Just open the door.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Yes, dear, I know.
Fuck you.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Because I think he's wrong.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Right... Right.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
Uh..he might of.
Got any easier questions?
Who did he leave with?
Okay.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Shit!
Coward!
All right.
What?!
It's not your fault.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Can you see anything?
Stop!
And I don't.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
James...
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
The option.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Oh, Laura.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
All right.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Right here. At the door.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
What happened to me?
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Okay.
Yeah.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Yeah.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
Yes.
That's correct. Look at me.
Lie down on the bed.
Railroad tickets.
I'll go then.
You haven't even heard from him?
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Listen to me I --
It's okay. It's okay.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Which language?
Yeah, hurry up though.
Me and John.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
Who's it, you mean.
I don't know.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
I'm fine. I'm
Hello.
Yes... I... yes.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Okay, sure, Mick.
I sure don't hate you.
Then it's worth the journey.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Did you bleed?
Kiss me.
Dr. Ruth?
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
You sleeping with her?
No, it's not Don.
Come on, gal...
You look beautiful to me.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
No.  Hi baby.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
My secret lover.
That's the problem.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Should have stayed a girl.
Then, shut up!
Italian?
Yes, but.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Speak to me Fucker.
More what?
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
On a ride.
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
We get on which plane?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Dr. Weir...!
Good, let's drink up.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
This is it.
We're not cops.
Alright.
Fine.
Of course, Jeffrey.
I want to go home.
Alright.
Really? What would it take?
Yeah.
We sure did.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Mexico.
I'll get a coat for her.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Hey Jeff.
Not at all
It's good to see you, Dad.
Italian.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
What are you listening to?
I don't know. He moved away.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Well, thanks, I --
Yeah. Good bye.
A wolf.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I guess in case one year they're not.
I'll drink to that.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Okay, Sandy.
Want company?
See ya tomorrow.
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
No.
I'm gettin' there
Okay. Great!
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Just a minute.
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
NO.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Let's wait for some slow one.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Okay.
I like to play "reality".
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Thank you, son.
Go ahead!
Good.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Oh, yah?
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
They won't until this is over.
Go find one.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Aye.
And I made these!
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Goodbye.
What?  What, that guy?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Am I in trouble?
You gotta keep going.
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ma, what's wrong?
Have a nice day.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
I thought that you were anyway.
BLAME...
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Our mother can see through bags.
Why, I needed a
Ass!
Well...
Italian.
Nothing
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
He's a good man.
Not bad, not bad.
Really want to know?
What? Why am I bad?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Not luck. They don't want me.
I...
Can you see anything?
We promise.
Thanks, Valentine ...
You sure you killed them?
He must still be in there.
Well, I'm sold.
Yes... It's true.
I mean he ain't here.
Good guess -- but no.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Ah!
God have mercy on my soul.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
See you, Bob.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
You're an idiot.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Just five or six people.
Hang on a second.
I'm not so bad.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Dignan! Stop!
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
You're right. You're right.
Me too.
We got it. We got it.
He's not here.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
I don't want anyone to die.
Bob?
He says he feels safe here.
No. We didn't.
That's OK.
No kidding.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Yes... It's true.
That's important.
Right here.
I think so, Sire, yes.
That's a long time to be in jail.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
We'll all go crazy...
OK.
Truly.
Can you hand me those french fries.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Would of been nice.
Yes.
Our money situation is not good.
What about the money?
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
We've got sixteen dollars.
I cannot.
Where's the rest?
What are you talking about?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Right now.
He didn't. Get over it.
He seems pretty good.
No one does till they learn....
Bob!
That's no bull.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
That's for sure, Frank.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
He was all right.
I'm just getting started....
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
That's so weird...
Get against the wall!
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
What are you talking about?
[A beautiful circle.]
I'll get him.
Tell me why he's dead.
There's not enough time.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Behind Bob's house.
I manage them.
Dignan, I --
It's not that nice.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Take a deep breath.
That's what I want to know.
It feels good.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
How'd he do?
Just like you always wanted.
Let them fight.
Help me.
See you, Bob.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Nobody does.
Well don't think!
OK, Dad.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Is that OK?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Sure.
Good.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
It's good to see you, Dad.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Feel this.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Where were you?
Yes.
Wait a second.
I will.
Bob! Get back in position!
Raw deal.
You're the faggot.
What did I say?
Good question.
Yes.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Yes.  I believed him.
Maybe she turned.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Let's just go.
It's a small town.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Don't worry.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Did we get it?
Three hundred pounds!
Don't count it.
When I go off?
No. I was calm.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Later.
I don't want to talk about it.
Not any more.
He wouldn't move.
That I'm a freak.
What are you talking about?
Then why do it?
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
...here!
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Let's go.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Anthony. Bad news.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
We're not cops.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
I didn't have any choice.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
That's OK.
Behind Bob's house.
Look. We want you on the job.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I think so.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Just my luck.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Okay.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Please. I can't bear it...
Did you hear that?
Right here. At the door.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
He's damn good.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
We're just going over a few things.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
What can we do?
I promised I wouldn't tell.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
But you --
Where?
You get time off to sleep.
She is a good looking woman.
Move you fools!
No, it's not.
How can anyone be that naive?
Nice to meet you.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Thanks.
Be careful, Danny.
The sooner the better.
Goodbye.
Okay...
Maybe.
I speak English.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
I killed them.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
I don't want you to forgive me.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Look at me.
Hold on
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
What?
I'm sorry.
Apple core?
Sorry. Old habits.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Cash.
-- take the back -- get another car --
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
They're dead, aren't they?
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
No, it can't!
-- hang on --
But there's...
Tell me later.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
It might have.
Daddy. Let go.
I only dream about people who are dead.
To hide the evidence.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Turn left at the lights.
I want to hear it from you.
My house?
Bourne?
Okay...
Careful...
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I'm working on it.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Now. Show now.
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Is there. Is all there.
You're not crazy.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
He will. I know he will.
Will you GO, damn you?
Aye.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Now what?
Aye, we'll get 'em.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
I will not.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
...Tonight!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
I need you so much! I love you!
Well, let's have a look.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I don't want anyone to die.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Yeah.  I guess.
Exactly.
But then when will we see each other?
Who would do such a thing?
Well, maybe you think I could!
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I... I don't remember.
What did you say?
Okay.
I think he's already feeling better.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I wish I could.
Cute, Evan.
Sure.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Do you?
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
You know my father?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Pretty boring, I guess.
I see a car.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Yes ma'am.
Duck, here they come.
No. I'll try again later.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Got to catch me first --
Hi, Lenny.
Not here... alone.  Please.
Those are your clothes, silly.
He's alright.
What?
Donnie? You're a dick.
He's a fucking maniac!
We move.  Place to place.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
She's right over there.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Been there, done that.
Let me see what I can do.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
He's busy being dead.
Me neither.
Maybe.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
What?
What happened?? Where are we?!
Coward!
What's wrong with you?!
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Don't ruin this for me.
Oh my God oh my God...
I hadn't planned on it.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
I don't know.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Home.
No.
You are frightened, no?
Well?
Let's wait for some slow one.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Just fine.
I'm sorry. It is.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Monsieur Rick!
Right.
Come up here a minute.
Sorry, Sir.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Good-bye!
Here's looking at you, kid.
Sorry.
Especially tonight.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Sure.
The stairs from the street.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Oh, Rick!
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Tunnel.
Won't you join us?
Don't want to film this?
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Yes, but.
Goodnight.
No.
Goodnight.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Thanks.
I love you very much, my dear.
God knows.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Hello, darling.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Any time.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Can't you do something?
Yes, rather.
Believe it.
Here it is.
Let's go, Jake?
Thank you.
No... Here he comes.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
-- Burn it all.
Good day.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Good evening, Captain.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Perhaps.
Good day.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Finish what?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
It goes in that little hole.
A wise foreign policy.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
-- Thanks. I will.
Here's hoping, baby...
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I never make plans that far ahead.
No, you get out of here.
Take your hands off me!
Goodbye.
Put it down!
The best table in the house.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
What.
Not right now.
Not here... alone.  Please.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Even by you?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Believe it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Get up, damn you.
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
No water, no work.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Who do you think I am?
No.
My house?
Survive today, that's the point.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
You are.
Anthony. Bad news.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
Go!!!
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Oh?  You've tried?
Or I could come back.
Sure.
You betrayed us.
Must be a story there.
Good.
So do I.
Tom...
Let me guess, Russia came up?
Aye.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
Yeah.
And for you --
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
For when I travel?
Just play a part. A little acting.
Yes there is.
Yeah...before your time.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
He made a cat.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I'll get my bag.
I would have done the same thing.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
If I'd known you were alive --
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Great.  Really.
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Rough life, Jack.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Oh, Rick!
That new roof, that's your doing.
You here again? What do you want?
It was fifteen minutes late.
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Morning, Captain.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Are you sick, Louis?
To Wilson.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Believe me I know.
Hello, darling.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Hey! Come out here!
Deep, real deep.
You're kidding.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Close up shop!
No sweat.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Yes. Exactly.
I was!
Can you check?
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
I'll go then.
Good night, Daddy.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
No.
"King Kong". It's really good.
Lower me down.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Oh, sure!
It's time. It's time now.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
There is no big job.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Can you see anything?
Just a little privacy.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
No.
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Mom...please.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Wait a second.
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
She knows how to take care of herself.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Hi...
No.
Yes, I *have*!
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
Why?
Because Dad left?
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Never a good thing.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Yeah.
Right.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Okay...
No.
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Only one you've never broken.
It's my turn!
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Then we'll never make it.
Right.
Yes, baby?
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
It's time. It's time now.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
No trouble.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Almost.
Did you have a dream?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Work.  Going to work.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
What view?
Name it.
What's lucky about that?
Did your wishes ever come true?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Well...sorry...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Really?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
She walked.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
You're welcome..
Let's go, Jake?
I have expectations, too.
Tonight. Just me.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Two million.
Well, I'm sold.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Okay. Great!
She's up for it.
You've lived here all your life?
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Is this your house?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Hey!
Help me.
Let me help you.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Morning, Captain.
We're not cops.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
You interested in a little work?
I have no idea.
Just play a part. A little acting.
Let's just see how we do.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Did I miss something?
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Don't ruin this for me.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
What about the money?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
No, I want my cut!
I don't know.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just a little way.
You sure?
Not really.
Where the hell is she?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Jake? Customs?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I'll find the time.
Let's get a hot dog.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
What, like it's that hard?
Confidence. It's just confidence.
What's the matter with my place?
I try.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
You betrayed us.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
We're here.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
She.
Goodnight.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
I'll take you up on that.
Where do I sign?
Sorry.
All right -
A couple I know are getting married.
Just play a part. A little acting.
She.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
And who do I go to about you?
You mean I won't resist them.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Turn around.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
What job?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
You've got such beautiful hands.
Yup.
I don't know.
It's something I do...
Fine.
Remember that.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Does what feel comfortable?
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Dr. Weir...!
No. Answer it!
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
It will.
Are you always this much fun?
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Have you done something to your hair?
How can anyone be that naive?
Shit.
Well, thank you anyway.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I don't gamble.
Excuse me?
Turn left ahead.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
What ten thousand pounds?
Can I buy you another drink?
But if it does.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
You betrayed us.
What about my neck?
You really want to help me?
No, forget it. The bet's off.
I wish he had a family, though.
I have to take the car.
Try me.
Thank you.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
No thank you.
Okay.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
You think so?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
What do you mean?
Turn left at the lights.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Have you got transport?
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
Thanks.
I don't know, Cole.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
You've done pretty well.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
Don't worry.
No.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll do that.
Jack.
Thank you, son.
Wipe your hands.
Thank you for taking me home.
Good call.
What is this?
I said good call.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
I'm playing to win.
Fine.
Sure.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Yes.
I think he's talking to it.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Thanks.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
And I saw that I was alone.
Claire...!
Who cares. Don't bother me.
No time.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Passion.
This.
They're my team.
Yeah?
I can't.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
If there's a train.
You know each other?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Where?
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
No time.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Don't look down.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
SHHH!  Don't do that!
[Daniel what?]
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Uh huh.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Oh?  You've tried?
I was expecting someone else.
You and me.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'll walk back.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
See you soon.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Open it.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I'll wait.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Let go of my hand.
Nothing.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Here's your money.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
You and me both.
He's no Steve Young.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Your father is proud of you.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Later.
I'll be your best friend.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
We're here.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
I'm so glad we agree.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I got a new deal for you.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Thanks.
Wade.
Believe it.
No.
Oh, screw it!
I mean, you're really back.
Bye.
You know who I am.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Check!
You see what's hanging on the wall?
The paint!
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Nah. Couldn't be.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
What?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
I have to go back now.
We won?!
All right.
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Well once. Mary.
The KISS Army!
I mean it.
Did you know him?
The machine works.  She is.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
I mean it.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Real rain?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Sure.
Okay.  But not water sports.
Sure.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
Where are we going?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
I'm going home.
What?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
You want to kiss me...
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
True.
What?
Yeah.
Maybe she's asleep.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Hey, wait a minute--
But you're OK?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
...Not yet.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Where are we going?
Can you bring Mr...
Who's Frank?
I want to fuck.
Yeah...
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I'm fucked!
Grandma Death.
No shit.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
All right, Caesar.
Don't you watch the news?
What's going on between you two?
No.  That's stupid.
He's alive.
Who is he going to kill?
That's not true.
Guess who wrote it?
You look like... Brian.
You're not a bitch.
I'll be back later...
Donnie? You're a dick.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
She's right over there.
Get out.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
You change partners, you change the rules.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
You've lived here all your life?
It's okay.
Thank you for taking me home.
We all do. Now let's go.
What do you want?
You heard me. Where is it?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Bitch!
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Hi.
Right.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
I can't.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Will you hang on just a second.
Close up shop!
I don't know.
Take a letter...
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
None of your business...  Take another letter.
She's still alive?
All right -
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
Nick's going?
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
And she left shortly after that?
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Seven.
Oh?
Run, stupid!
How lovely.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Oh, yes.
I don't know.
Do you?
You're for real?
Did you see it?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'll get my bag.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Shut up!
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Get out of here.
Right... Right.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Indeed!
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
And what was that, John?
I'll help you.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Jack.
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
No, thank you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
No women?
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Coward!
No, but I certainly shall.
Am I in trouble?
Yes.
It was you.
No, nothing.
I killed them.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Of course! What did you think?
You don't understand you either.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Like what? Your sign?
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Here.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
I would now.
...Can you cure me?
Don't say a .
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Oh...
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Yeah. I got out.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
I will go and wake them up!
Yes.
Tell me your name?
Yes.
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
It's illegal.
What?
I wonder, maybe...
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Nobody gets killed.
Yes, I am rather.
No, don't say anything else!
... death ...
Oh...
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
I'm drowning! Help!
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Here we are.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I was not.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
To freedom.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Yeah?
I could get a search warrant.
It's okay.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Okay.
I do?
Tomorrow?
Oh, don't be silly.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
No, you're not.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I know.
I did it. I guess that means something.
You do it. You're a girl.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Nothin'.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
What's that?
It's freezing out here.
No.
Yeah.
The hell I can't.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
'Night.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Yup.
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
Shit!
Why?  I don't know.
Hell no.
What's lucky about that?
Can I... I brought some --
What did I say?
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
You're under arrest.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
No way...
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Who?
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Beautiful.
I think I found something...
Just don't lie to me.
No, thank you.
Why?
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Because I'm going to get my father!
From the Other Place...
Thank you, Harry.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
Frozen.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Better if I just show you.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
That shouldn't be a problem.
Dr. Weir...!
A girl.
We have a situation here...
Where's the money hid.
Do you know what it was?
And how come you're up so early?
I don't care.
Goodnight.
What did he do to the uniform?!
What did he want?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Close it!
This makes five.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Solid.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Yeah.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
No: You're ON FIRE!
I...
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
What yard? When who-
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Okay.  Fine.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Passion.
I start on Monday.
If it happened to him, then it could...
No... of course not.
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
You need a doctor.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
That's what matters, isn't it?
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's the first door on your left.
Okay. Okay.
Don't strain yourself.
Okay.
I take out the garbage.
First time for everything.
But your face did!
Won't you join us for a drink?
You are a virgin!
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
I didn't say that.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
OH MY GOD!
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
All right, then. It's your secret.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
How about both of us at the same time?
I won't let anybody take you.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
I guess I did.
I'll call you again.
Hello.
I could have struck off his head just now!
What? Now?
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Oh, don't be silly.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Naw. I don't mind.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
What?
Part of what?
Yes, ma'am.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Right.
Because I'm going to get my father!
Nah, I got the gun.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
Anybody else?
...I...don't know.
Nothing.
It's a letter to my father.
What's going on between you two?
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
That's good...
No shit.
We'll work it out.
Go!!!
Oh...I'll think of something.
Right.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
You're under arrest.
I don't feel well.
Thank you, Harry.
No more than this?
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
...Then go.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
I'm buying.
What is this?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
....this is your mistake....
Yeah.
So long.
You don't know what you want.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
He needs me here.
No, we're not.
Why?
Just a little way.
Deep, real deep.
Yes.
Really want to know?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
I'm sorry.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Have you got transport?
Sure.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
I was watching.
That's not it.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Time for what?
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Victor. I love you,
But if you could?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
John, you can't help her now.
It's a letter to my father.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Right! Right!
Let's go to the hospital.
Maybe I can help?
What name is he using?
You're welcome.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Because Dad left?
For two lonely nights.
What's the matter with my place?
Yeah.
No?
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
Right! Right!
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
Thank you, son.
Well, what is it?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
No, you're not.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Here. Hit it here.
You best better get it done, Pops.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
YOUNG BLOOD
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
What?
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
I'm so glad we agree.
Hold it!
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
I was wrong.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Really? I'd like to find out.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Tom... she's dead.
Where are you?
All right...
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I'll walk back.
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Nine feet -- ten --
THIS much.
All right, then. It's your secret.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Of course I do.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
You're kidding.
I wish she was beneath me.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
I mean I don't care.
Yes.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
We'll get it later.
I don't want you to forgive me.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
No, it's not.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
That's correct. Look at me.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
I'm looking at you.
You do it. You're a girl.
What do you think?
Nice to meet you.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Really.
She's very beautiful.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Yes, but.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
Daddy. Let go.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Open it.
I don't hear anything.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Lemme see.
Nobody gets killed.
Morning, skipper.
Will you shut up!?!!
Wrong. It's Friday.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Yes.
Yeah.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
I like my job.
I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Good for you.
Right.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Then you're a lucky man.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Right.
A quarter of a million dollars.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
You scared me.
No. I'll try again later.
All right. Heads then.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
But you'll do it?
I don't know.
I do.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Ho, baby!
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Solid.
JUST DO IT!
No way...
Yeah, well... hi...
Yes.
Why don't you ask him.
Tom... she's dead.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Pour that back.
It's a surprise.
Look who's talking.
I don't believe you.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Anthony's II!
Yeah. But enough about me.
No way... when?
I'd love one.
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
Why? What did he say?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Just because.
You're just scared.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
It doesn't matter.
It's kind of falling apart.
You're a fool.
Later, "Dude".
Yeah.
OH MY GOD!
I don't know.
"Yet."
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
That's more like it.
Uh... sure... come in.
Do I?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Okay, Matt.
What's the matter?
Drop that fucking money!
Do you have a check for me?
Will you sign the register, please?
So work must be going well?
Where are we going?
Then why do it?
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
Possibly.
Where he always is.
Because I think they're after you.
Yes --
You give me hope, John.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Do you love her?
But there's no more drug.
I do, actually, very much.
Of course.
They will want a lot of money.
You look beautiful to me.
That's exactly what you said last week.
Making things real rough for Hal.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
How do you know?
You're right.  We should stay.
Yeah. Good bye.
Nine feet -- ten --
This ain't no photo.
Oh, Ray --
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Well don't think!
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Well, thanks a lot.
Thanks!
Are you sick, Louis?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
All right, what happened to me?
Yes.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Yes.
Good guess -- but no.
Like what? Your sign?
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Yeah.
Anything!  Just make contact.
You hear what I said?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Fourteen hundred.
Frozen.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Ah.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
I think you do.
On my honor as your daddy...
Yes.
That's one way to look at it.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
No.
Yeah?
Are you going to graduate school?
Are you afraid of me?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Don't be cruel.
I just want to tell you something.
I am committed. I love you.
Where is the car?
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
No.
I don't know. He moved away.
All right.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Is anything wrong?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Just a little way.
Of course not.
So are you engaged, or what?
And it's all over now.
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I do.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
You mean the one who --
Will you kiss me!
Get out of here.
Oh, damn!
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Oh.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Morning, Captain.
What?
Oh.  You're them.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Yes.
What did she say?
Let me see what I can do.
Let me go.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I don't feel well.
First time for everything.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
No.  I'm okay.
Will you kiss me!
I'm going to puke in it...
I have to go back now.
Next assignment?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Why do you have to see him?
Kill me.
Where did he do it?
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
Oh no. He said that.
Sorry, Miss.
Shhhh.
I'm cool.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
Well I'll hand it to you.
No, depends on nothing.
Right.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Will you sign the register, please?
Well then ... shall we?
That's right.
There is no big job.
In general.
What's the difference?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Three...
Let's go.
That's a long time to be in jail.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Mom, it's ...
Please.
Don't say a .
I don't know.
No.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
No.
Thank you for taking me home.
I have a watch.
Okay.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Reading.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
All right, then. It's your secret.
I'm curious.
Dinner at the White House.
Because I don't want you to.
I... I don't remember.
I have my reasons.
Shit!
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I guess we are.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Did I say that?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Michael.   Yes.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
So... how did they get here?
Thank you.  Benjamin --
I bet.
Do exactly what I say.
Apple core?
I don't think so.
Oh...I'll think of something.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Why don't you try?
When I go off?
I know, honey.  Me too.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
It's the first door on your left.
Meet someone?
Thank you.
Oh, no.
We get on which plane?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
No wait. Wait.
Wipe your hands.
About an hour ago.
...Then go.
I don't know. I want it to be --
Delicious.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Yes.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
That what he says. Right?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Please.
Yes, sir.
Go! Just go!
Yes, I am rather.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
Because you love me -- you love me?
Merrick...
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Bullshit.
Certainly.
Why do you have to see him?
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
No.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Bless you --
Right.
Till then.
Mom.
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Look at me.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
You think so?
Sorry!
Yes --
You tell me.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
He must still be in there.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
A long time to wait.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
Call me later.
I like you, too.
What if you don't close...?
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
If there's a train.
Only one arm?
Where is the car?
You always did.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
You, too, Roy.
Oh yeah?
I'll get it.
Oh.  You're them.
NO!
No... no.
No more than this?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Roy? It this all we have?
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
All? It ain't bad.
Not here... alone.  Please.
I'll see you when you get home.
You change partners, you change the rules.
Open it and find out.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Oh, come here.
Bullshit.
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
No, its -- Why did she--?
What do they need her for?
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
It's the first door on your left.
And miss the big game?  No way.
What else?
I'm not leaving without her.
You gotta give me some money.
John, you can't help her now.
You got that right.
What?  Where is she?
I said let's go, Charlie.
I can't afford to get caught.
Again.  Try again.
Then I'll get caught.
Kill me.
Here, take my jacket.
The big one.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
That's for sure, Frank.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Oh.
Shit happens.
You look nervous.
Can't you?
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
I promise.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Promise?
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
I've come to help your family.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
You stay away from him!
But if it does.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Leave the boy.  Take me.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
We've never met.
Well, let's have a look.
Mom?
Listen to me I --
It's Mom.
I...
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
Okay.
No, it's not.
No!
Anonymous.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
You wife isn't dead is she?
After this dance.
Where did you get that film?
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Get out!
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
But I'm here to help you...
Oh.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
Shit.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Well, thanks a lot.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
But I...
Yes, it must be.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Out!
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Or I could come back.
No.  I thought not.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
All right.
Fine.
My door is always open.
None of your business...  Take another letter.
All right.
All right...
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Surprise me.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
I don't know. Oh.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
Are we going to argue?
It certainly is.
You always been this selfish?
Because I'm going to get my father!
Did you bleed?
Finish what?
In my room.
I've come for my father!
I don't know.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
That's a damn long time...
I'm in charge. We go back!
You always did.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
All right.
Good night.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
No. Myers is taking me.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
You're going alone?
Should have stayed a girl.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Yeah.
My fucking hand!
Dead, I'm afraid.
Not much.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Bitch.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
You really want to help me?
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
Really? Really!!!
Come to Daddy.
Come on!
You want it?
Surprise me.
I came for the wedding.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
A werewolf?
I said: don't look.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Frank.
Yes, but.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
I don't know.
Back from where?
Gotcha.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
One more. Maybe two --
Am I? Let's find out.
Tell me, damn you.
What the hell are you saying?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Not know.
Daphne, I...
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Maybe we should just leave --
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
That's where I always go when I get out.
Ah!
Go?
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
Tell me!
Oh Christ. Julia...
Ok.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Nick?
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Try me.
Oh, babe...
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Only I'll turn it off --
Now look at him...
Come with me then.
Say the Word!
Please. I can't bear it...
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
It's better you see for yourself --
Alright.
I wonder, maybe...
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
That's more like it.
Tom...
That's right.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
No personal details?
Do I?
Wait a moment --
Please. I can't bear it...
I said: I found a room.
Will I see you again?
What did you say?
Are we going to argue?
Do you want me to come over?
Say them.
Me like.
I don't know.
Steve?
Tell me your name?
I love you too.
Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
No way...
Show her.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
No you don't.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
Yes!
How long ago was it?
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
No, Dignan. This isn't --
All right.  No. That's nice.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
If there's a train.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
What do we do if there isn't?
Oh, Rick!
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
No, it's good to see you.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
If I make it through the day.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Right.
I won't let anybody take you.
Where did he do it?
Will you GO, damn you?
I'll be another!
Terrific.
Who did he leave with?
Ooh.  Drag.
What ten thousand pounds?
You'd love it!
I NEED SOME
Who's that?
Why, you look beautiful.
Well stay for tonight, then.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
My house?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Are you coming home?
You?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Your father is proud of you.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I guess.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
They're my team.
You know what I mean.
Of course. Please have a seat.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
What say we flip for it?
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
What's that?
Right.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Right.
Fuck you.
I'll call you.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Fine.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
What the hell is going on?
What?
And you?
I don't know. I want it to be --
Maybe.
Yes.
You're wrong.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
You're a fool.
Not too good.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
Good-bye, darling.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
I'd like you to try.
By all means.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
We've got nothing to say.
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
You're afraid to say.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
What happened to the baby?
Again.  Try again.
Oh, come on!
Like you.
Did you hear that?
Kiss me.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
It's all we have.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
It never changes, Major.
Okay.
What name is he using?
All right.
As you wish.
We're too late. Take a look.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where are we going?
Out some place.
Here, take my jacket.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
So long.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
This is really awkward...
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Railroad tickets.
He's not here now, is he?
Is he coming back here?
He had an orange hat on.
Finished!
What can we do?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
You're afraid to say.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Point the gun at me!
I dunno.
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Could you do anything about it?
I guess so.
Okay, sure, Mick.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Not this gun!
A lady. She died.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Want to try it again?
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Say them.
Say them.
This time I mean it.
Could.
Fine, I'm doing it.
You couldn't.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
You do it. You're a girl.
If you could, you would have brought one today.
It's not the same.
The usual...
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
After this dance.
Thank you very much.
Or what?
What the hell is going on?
Look after yourself, Grace.
I'm sorry. It is.
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Well, yeah, kind of.
I said okay?
Yeah, come on.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
He left!
Well... not in the common way.
I don't know.
How about you?
She looks like a freak.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Then run him over, he'll move.
I see...
Fine! I'll go straight!
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
It won't work.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
When you were outside with Bill.
Would you shut up?
Help, help us.
You mean the snake.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
What for?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Okay.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
No.
On a ride.
You tell me.
You promise?
Twelve thousand.
Right back where we started.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Deal.
I'm so glad you're alive.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Heck, no!  What?!
Tell her what?
No.
By all means.
Duck, here they come.
Yeah. Sure.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Yeah. You must come again.
I'm not scared.
Can I buy you another drink?
Oh, yes.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Not me.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
I have to go.
Give me a drag.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Come here.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Oh, I forgot.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
What's it so hot in here for?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
First time for everything.
Thank you very much.
A week? A year?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
No.
Do you want to go on?
Who was that?
We move.  Place to place.
We are?
Yes.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Where you lived with them.
We've never met.
You want to kill them.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Humans.
Maybe.
That's fine.
Right back where we started.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Don't you threaten me!
Better now, son?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Why, yes.  Why?
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Can you tell me about that?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
The State Police.
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
Are we locked down?
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
I think you do.
He's not going to listen to me.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
A toast to the end of the world.
Where did you get that film?
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Just do it!
Hell no.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Am I? Let's find out.
Then God help us.
See you soon.
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
The Name of God...
Marge, you like everybody.
Lower me down.
Tell me why he's dead.
Junior!
Taking out what you should never have put in.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
You're all right.
Thank God!
Tell me!
Rats?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Then let us prepare.
They want my diary.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Dad!
Yeah. I care, Dil.
It happens to me all the time.
Yes, baby?
A long time to wait.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
No problem.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Then we'll die.
I want to hear it from you.
First of all -- don't panic!
Stand back.
That's good -- you're doing fine.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Maybe...
As a matter of fact, I do.
Dr. Jones?
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
I just want to look ...
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Just don't lie to me.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Well, thank you anyway.
Yes, they believe you.
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
I'm going to puke in it...
Feel this.
I'm...inside you.
Somewhere else?
I see...
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Yeah.
You're afraid to say.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Good call.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
He didn't come home.
With Authority!
That's right.
Where are we going?
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
The man.
Please put it down.
We get on which plane?
We?
It's illegal.
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
...Just beautiful.
Won't I ever see you again?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
A girl.
Trust me.
How should I know?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Which language?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
What about tomorrow?
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
A quarter of a million dollars.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
The drinks...Stay on them.
And on to a bigger one with you?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Me too.
What is it?
She's alive?
You get time off to sleep.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Run, stupid!
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Neither can they.
You look beautiful to me.
He was with Gruner!
I love you.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
And she left shortly after that?
Where?
Do they drug you?
Don't worry, I can.
In your dreams.
I don't know.
But there's no more drug.
Oh no!
We're ready.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
On a ride.
Some friend you are! You know what I hope?
I mean, you're really back.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
The best part. She'll love it.
Are we locked down?
Good.
Please...
Then what?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Bit expensive, sir.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Join us.
No way...
Yes. Joe.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Okay.
Oh yeah, thanks...
What's wrong with me?
Whatever it is, don't do it.
I guess I did.
What?
No, nothing.
Oh...I can't. Business.
See you, Ginger.
Without what?
No he won't.
Like there's someone else here.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
...I...don't know.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
Why didn't you tell me?
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
I want you to calm down.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
THIS much.
Sure I can, can't I?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
What did you tell them?
I want to try it.
That I really don't know.
No, thank you.
Now what?
Here's looking at you, kid.
Nothing we can do.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Can't you do something?
Great. That's great.
For you.
Oh...
We just don't stop.
Listen to me John.
It wasn't me. It was him.
Come on.
It was you.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
He told me what to do.
That ' s what I thought
The experiment. The danger...
I never said you were "nothing".
Perfectly.
It's killing me.
There's Dad, on TV.
Do you want me to come over?
Mom.
Do exactly what I say.
Yes, baby?
I stole them.
You got a deal.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
I'll be there.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
P.J.'s.
I think I could do that alone.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
How about you?
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Are you sure?
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
That's for food.
That's good.
Who is this?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
What's this?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Everything. Just for the record.
Like what? Your sign?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
No. I mean since whenever...
Promise?
Hello, can you hear me now?
Won't you join us for a drink?
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
My God, but you're determined.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I have a watch.
I won't let anybody take you.
I bet.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Tell me!
It's okay Joe.
She fucked me too.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
What?!
What the fuck...?
Well... OK...
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
The experiment. The danger...
You have your nerve!  Here, boy!
Our money situation is not good.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
'Night.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Try me.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Won't I ever see you again?
Because it was a lie.
Sorry, Miss.
You must be exhausted.
Thank you.
Sit down.
In about fifteen minutes.
I need you so much! I love you!
Don't accept any more.
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Oh!!
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
Yes, it must be.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
I think I found something...
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
No, it can't!
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
That's one way to look at it.
Yes, Max, I understand.
No.  She told me "right now."
I won't forget.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
You.
And I don't.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Especially tonight.
You're serious?
Of course, I do.
Black's fine.
I'd like that.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
Goodbye, Stew
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Norma, are you alright?
Yeah.
How about White?
You planted that shit on me.
I bet.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
You know what we want.
Can you tell me about that?
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Where did you get that film?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Sure have...
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
It's a start.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
I want to thank you for what you've done.
No, don't. But thanks.
Nothing personal.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Nobody does.
LET GO!
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Daddy. Let go.
Which language?
What do you want from me?
Yes.
Just my luck.
I...
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Oh, Laura.
Mom, it's ...
Kill me.
It's cold.
That's okay.
Tell your mother.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Shit!
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Only what you take with you.
Jake, you need to rest.
Come on.
I just want to look ...
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Get your clothes off!
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
I'm not leaving without her.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Where have they gone?
What else is left for a man without friends.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
I don't know. I want it to be --
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Where have they gone?
I said let's go, Charlie.
You know who I am.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I know. That's why I'm asking.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
Oh, come on!
Not that.
I don't know. Nothing.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
When I go off?
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
As far as you trust me.
I get it.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Your father.  He was your father.
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
I want him out of the ocean.
NO!
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Thirty seconds.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Are we locked down?
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I want him out of the ocean.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
I think they make you look sexy.
You know each other?
He's sitting in it.
Tell him I said "hi".
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Okay.
I miss it too.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
I'm calling Gary.
Can you see it?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
...Thank you.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
Not really.
A present I picked up for you.
Yeah.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
As many times as it takes.
Hey.
Damn right I do.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Take your time.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
You didn't?
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Maybe she's asleep.
Hold on.
What? Why am I bad?
Yeah.
I'm so glad we agree.
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
Do you want me to come over?
Of course I do.
I don't know!
Of course I do.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
Like...
Did you bleed?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
I didn't bleed.
Look at my lips.
You didn't?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I gotta find him.
You mean the one who --
Sweet.
What did he want?
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
It's a long way to go for a date.
That's right.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
All right.
Where were you?
What are you saying?
Sure.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
What was suspicious about him?
Let's go, Jake?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Don't accept any more.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Of course not.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Then we'll die.
But you promised.
No shit.
This ain't no photo.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
I went out.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
It matters to me.
Who says something's on my mind.
Movin' it out, boss.
No.  I don't.
Please. I can't bear it...
No you didn't.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
Where do I sign?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Jim Younger, I told you--
Because I think he's wrong.
But this is absurd!
Why?
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
Yeah.
I can't wait either.
I don't want anyone to die.
I knew you would come.
I think.
Yes.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Even by you?
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
I cannot.
Do you want to go on?
Staying alive.
Where's the money hid.
What else is left for a man without friends.
No.
Then he will die!
Look. We want you on the job.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
You're kidding.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
Put your shoulders back.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
What yard? When who-
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
No, I won't go with you
I think.
Can you check?
Three times, then two times.
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
Goodnight.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
No, nothing.
Yeah, what?
Never say anything unless you have to.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
I mean, you're really back.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
I wish I could.
I don't follow.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Why do you polish it?
Look who's talking.
I will -- I promise.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
Why, you look beautiful.
Yes.
Protect life... Until death.
Did you have a dream?
You're all right.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Nick's going?
Yeah!
Okay...It's so good to see you.
California.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Cute.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Hold on, Alice.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Go ahead!
Yes, that's right.
There's not enough time.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Well... OK...
You're crazy.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
OK.
What's fair?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
P.J.'s.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Barbara.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I was wrong.
I believe we are.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
The bedroom.
That's not what's important.
I'll go then.
How about --
No.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
I just want to look ...
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
Could you do anything about it?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
Bye...
What, like it's that hard?
I can get it. I can just...
You got into Harvard Law?
What did you mean by that?
At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...
You will, Dil
I could have struck off his head just now!
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
How many?
I would have anyway.
It happens to me all the time.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
I'll pay for it.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
The man.
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
The gear is down.
Tell him I said "hi".
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
No.  That's okay.
Okay.
I might not stay, anyway.
You promise?
I'll get your back.
Let's just go.
I'm not gay.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Not if what he left me was real.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I don't wanna go.
Well, maybe you think I could!
No.
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
We're getting out of the ground today.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Mom...please.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Oh, okay.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I've been thinking.
I might have a solution.
What do you mean by that?
That's not true.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
That's so weird...
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Because Dad left?
Let me go.
She's a little sad, is all.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Where he always is.
Who's that?
The first and the last.
Look, we gotta talk.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Only one arm?
Which?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
I'm so glad you're alive.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
Thank you, Harry.
You've never said that before.
You owe me six big ones.
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
It would worry me.
Are you scared?
I'd be you.
Don't accept any more.
Please don't leave me.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
That's the problem.
This could be it.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Okay...
It's not ours.  It's George's.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
Okay.
I won't...don't worry.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
Surprise me.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
No. I mean since whenever...
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Maybe.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Who are you, Jerry?
I'll be right back.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
I never said you were "nothing".
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
It was a hate crime.
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
What did he want?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
No more than this?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
Who is this war against, Sam?
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
To let it dry.
It's too late for plans.
Yeah.
Movin' it out, boss.
What do they need her for?
He must still be in there.
Yeah.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Tell me!
That's a long story...
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
I... do not want this...
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Shit!
I love you.
No, we're not.
We're ready.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Should we explore?
Why did you do that???!!!
It's okay Joe.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
Then it's still no.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Of course.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
All right.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
And yours.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
I won't.
Let's go.
Then the answer's yes...
Who did he leave with?
I don't know... but it does.
She's up for it.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Okay.
And all alive you say?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Oh, yes... I think...
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Oh my... I'll try.
It's not.
Can you make it back?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Pile in.
But do you mean it?
You okay?... What's wrong?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Anonymous.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Ours, Ed.
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
But why not?
Okay, baby.
Look, I don't want your money!
I'll call you again.
As far as you trust me.
No... no.
Two... THREE. GO!
I don't know.
Know what?
We should stop seeing each other.
We're getting out of the ground today.
Yeah. Call him.
No trouble.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Alice?
Oh Christ. Julia...
Sit down.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
What happened to me?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
You're all right.
No... Here he comes.
I can paint anywhere.
He didn't come home.
Why do you polish it?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Will you sign the register, please?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Yeah.
At your house.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
Wake me up when you get home.
That's important.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Now! We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
Put them away.
No... of course not.
Do it!
Which would you choose?
Track you down and --
You know who it is.
You don't understand you either.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
What do you think?
What?
Come on!
Yeah.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Come on... get in.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Yes and no...
Go home, Sheila.
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Why, you look beautiful.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Well, good luck with the job.
No.
Your mother.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
Just a minute.
In case I need it.
We don't know. West is dead.
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
I don't want it.
So... how did they get here?
... Are you sure you like it?
Maybe you need a closer look.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
Barbara.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
Who?
Can I buy you another drink?
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Yes.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Yes, sir.
The other two will die without me.
Did you hear what I said?
She's still alive?
Sort of... Yeah.
She grew up.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
RUN!
Nick's going?
Somewhere.
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yes.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Now look at him...
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Does it feel comfortable?
Take your time.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
What the hell.
No way. I always do my own work.
Hold your breath, Dad...
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
You want to kill them.
Tell me!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Who made you do this?
Oh.
Kill me!
Alright.
Good-bye, Crow.
Did you hear what I said?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
He's not here now, is he?
Get out of here.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
We used to, every summer.
Exactly.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That was our apartment.
Yeah.
Yes.
It's difficult.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
There is that.
He's great, right. Is he great?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
He's alright.
It's not your fault.
I know.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Go.
Okay!  Damn!
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
No personal details?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
Next assignment?
Bobby.
Right.
Yeah.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
I'm just getting started....
He's not here.
Goodbye.
Can you check?
This ain't no photo.
Thanks.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
She really liked the kitchen.
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
No. Look. There.
I'll come straight there.
Fuck this.
WHAT?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
No, depends on nothing.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
...hundred yards further down the road.
You got that right.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Yes.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Yes.
Yes. Sing some more.
What? Why am I bad?
Yes.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You want another drink?
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
That shouldn't be a problem.
Give me the keys.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
No.. I've slept enough.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
You, too, Roy.
You owe me six big ones.
I wish it were that easy...
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Delicious.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Really? Really!!!
How do you know?
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Please. I can't bear it...
With him?
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Could I see it?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
Yes, Max, I understand.
[Daniel what?]
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
[I want you.]
See if these two are my friends.
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
I don't care.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Rats?
Creasy...
Who would do such a thing?
I know. But which state?
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
I'm looking for potential.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
But why not?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh...
For you.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
I NEED SOME
Yeah. Two or three.
No Marty, I don't.
You were never late before, I was worried.
Yeah.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Get anything?
Are you afraid of me?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
Yes.  You'll be outside.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
[A beautiful circle.]
I think they make you look sexy.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Marty...
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Okay.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Be right with you.
I feel... okay.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Can you see it?
Morning, Captain.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Why?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
You didn't?
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
I wish he had a family, though.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
What?
Right here. Sit down.
Maybe.
Where's Connell?
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Yes.  I believed him.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Who's your friend?
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Deal.
Yeah.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Twelve thousand.
You're gettin' the car.
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
'Night, Al.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
I'll be another!
Like it had to be done.
He's busy being dead.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Good night.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
To run late!
No.  Hi baby.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
Us.  Owe us.
Occasionally you lose.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
Don't worry.
I've proved that, didn't I?
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Pour that back.
Just now.
We'll stop then.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Do it!
Thank God!
I've been thinking.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Come on!
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
-- You've made your point!  You've got control of the system.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
It's all been transferred.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Just like you always wanted.
What can we do?
From the dream.
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
So wrong --
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
The truth.
But you'll do it?
To hide the evidence.
Trust me...
For what?
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
You weren't real.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
What's the difference?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Try me.
Come on.
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
-- Burn it all.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
No you don't.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Gives us something in common.
Only what you take with you.
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
I won't let anybody take you.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
I think you do.
But there's...
She.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Sure.
See if these two are my friends.
Yeah.
Never threaten me, Boss.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Hell. It's been four days!
I'm so glad you're alive.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
This is nice. I mean it.
It's a start.
Yeah...before your time.
Yes, they believe you.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
'Night.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
No.
Have a nice day.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You don't like where I live?
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
That's taking place outside now.
I'll be right back.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Why not?
It'll spoil our supper.
Yes!!!
Check!
You are , aren't you?
Dead people?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Fine.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Which language?
Why don't you try?
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Nothing
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
What did you mean by that?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
You threw them out!
Who was scary?
All right.
One more. Maybe two --
I don't blame you.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Mary - I - excuse me
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Running away is no solution.
Neither can they.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Right.
Frozen.
Yes.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Yeah.
Let me go!
He's busy being dead.
We'll send for the police!
But I'm here to help you...
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
I will -- I promise.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh. That.
You always been this selfish?
Take the stand!
What, like it's that hard?
Thank you, Your Honor.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
That I'm a freak.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Okay.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Not any more.
Rough life, Jack.
But you do therapy?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Who was that?
Because I think they're after you.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
You and me.
Doc.
The option.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Should we explore?
I think you do.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Why don't you tell me?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
We'll work it out.
You weren't real.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Joey.
Really? What would it take?
Every day.
What is your name?
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
I gotta go.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
How did you know?
It matters to me.
What can we do?
You and Candy...?
Right! Right!
Three hundred pounds!
....this is your mistake....
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Apple core?
Trust me.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
-- hang on --
Well neither do I, thank you.
How can anyone be that naive?
I was eight.
I won't let anybody take you.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Remember the cat.
Is anything wrong?
Roy.
See you then.
Who?
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
Every night.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
That was easy.
What did I say?
Sure.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
When I am sure I am among friends.
Then the answer's yes...
So when are we gonna have an on night?
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Good point.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
SO WHAT?
See if these two are my friends.
See ya tomorrow.
I do, actually, very much.
Ask her out.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Or both.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Right.
Can you see it?
My God, what a fire!
You're my brave boy.
Yes, it must be.
Let's see it.
Yes.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Do you expect me to believe that?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I guess we are.
I just wanted to give you this.
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
Yeah.
Nothing.
Then what?
What?!
I liked the horse.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Okay?
Yeah, and hurry up.
No, it's not Don.
'Take your car?'
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
Oh yeah?
The grave. Somebody close?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
What the hell are you saying?
You might wanna think about it
What?
You change partners, you change the rules.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You...
Who was that?
Tell me why he's dead.
Yes sir.
How should I...?
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
Okay.
Okay...
Great. You can go in my place.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
How did you see us kiss?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
I know you do, honey.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
To be a hero?
Yeah.
Keep it.
Right now.
What!?
No. I was calm.
I see. Where is this gun?
Okay.
Could I see it?
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
It goes in that little hole.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Did you know him?
It doesn't look like it.
Don't worry, I can.
It's time. It's time now.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
Right there.
That's not true.
Just put her on.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Boys?
Listen to me John.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Just fine.
Right. Okay. Good.
Ah.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
You'll find out.
It'll spoil our supper.
What I asked you earlier?
Dead.
Our money situation is not good.
No. No.
Mark!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Yeah.
Where's the money hid.
Not this gun!
Because John said I mustn't.
We don't know. West is dead.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
You look like... Brian.
Who was scary?
I can't.
Not really.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Krueger?
Good.
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
I will.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Okay.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
From the dream.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
So are we.
Of course. What's that?
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Here we are.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Because you love me -- you love me?
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Thirty seconds.
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
Victor. I love you,
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Jake, you need to rest.
All right.
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Why?
Home.
We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
I'm their ride.
'Night, Al.
The sooner the better.
How do you see this?
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
You should ask Bobby.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Can you tell me about that?
Of course.
Life is just... too awful.
It's hard to lose ...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'll never run again.  I promise.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
And then you'll be happy?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Way up ahead!
I don't know. Oh.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Well. If you say so.
What?!
Don't hurt no one.
Where are you?
I mean the nature of you.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
Do you know where I'm going?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Now. We close now.
Tell him I said "hi".
Well...
For when I travel?
You've lived here all your life?
I'm goin'.
All right. Heads then.
You tell me.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
Only I'll turn it off --
The option.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
No. You don't.
Will you kiss me!
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Tell him what you told me.
There's Dad, on TV.
This is really awkward...
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Do it!
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I didn't care about the money.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
We were engaged.
What do they need her for?
Umm...
Since you've had sex?
You still in love?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I have to leave now.
Probably.  One of the many.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Did you hear what I said?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
I'm sorry. It is.
Well, but Pete...
Did you hear what I said?
Great. You can go in my place.
You will wish you hadn't.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Don't forget me.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I'll walk back.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
That's okay.
No, they're for your mom.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Because he's my friend, too.
I don't want it.
Please...
Oh.
Yes.
But there's...
Remember that.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I can't.
Will you sign the register, please?
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
I need you so much! I love you!
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Shut up and let me think.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Jesus, what was I thinking?
By burning down their homes?
No, you can't come in.
I mean I don't care.
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Yes.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
You threw them out!
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
Fourteen hundred.
Fuck her too.
You're right.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
I mean, it's your life.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
The sheets...
Get the fuck out of my house!
Want to try it again?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
No way. I always do my own work.
Close it!
Yes.
Get out of the fucking car.
What did he want?
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Then fuck it!!!
It's a start.
Who is this war against, Sam?
The hell I do.
Then I love it.
Very well, then.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Of course, I do.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
As you wish.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
You did good.
Colonel will do.
Just open the door.
She is.  Don't go in there.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Jack?  What was that?
That's a damn long time...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
I hope so.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Yes, he does.
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
Humans.
God willing.
Here.
Put them away.
But there's...
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
All right. Heads then.
Yes--
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
I know.
Why, what's gonna happen?
Good for you.
What the hell is going on?
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
You change partners, you change the rules.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
I don't think so.
This time I mean it.
Michael.   Yes.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Good d--
Come here -
You can't.  I can.
Oh God!  He killed them!
Track you down and --
No. You don't.
That's fair.
You owe me six big ones.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
Yes, it must be.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
What?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Enough.
What I asked you earlier?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Not that.
Well neither do I, thank you.
You know, this and that.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
Solid.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
Your father.  He was your father.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Right here.
Goodbye, Stew
I guess.
You're all right.
What is your name?
For the letters, of course.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Yes - isn't it?
Deal.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Listen!  Hear that?
Outside!
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
and those and them.
Then start taking them seriously.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Let's do it.
Good.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Get out of here.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
Yeah.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Ah.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
No ... They won't be able to tell.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
No, no ... Come on in.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Yes she is.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
No I'm not.
Fire.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Three hundred pounds!
Real rain?
Great. You can go in my place.
YOU get lost!
Did you go home with him?
It's fine.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Dr. Weir...!
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
That's it?
Nice ... Nice ...
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
Get out of here.
EXCUSE ME?
It might have.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Yeah.
I brought you something ... From the library.
It's a surprise.
Well here I am.
You're an idiot.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
She doesn't answer me either.
You look nervous.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
I have no idea.
What?
....this is your mistake....
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Are you telling me no?
I mean, it's your life.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
Ok.
I hadn't planned on it.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Yes I do.
That bad?
Sure.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
When am I going to see you?
Nothing.
Everything, but everything.
What did he want?
Curious.
I thought that you were anyway.
Don't say a .
Let's go to the hospital.
Are you afraid of me?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
You gotta give me some money.
Yes.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Am I?
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
You're just scared.
There you go.  Love you.
He needs me here.
I know. I was there.
I don't care.
Pity.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
Bob! Get back in position!
None of your fuckin' business.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Where we going?
Come here.
I can't...
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
You're hurting my arm.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Look!
Not a word.
I wish it were that easy...
Not yet, Jeff.
Artie! Artie!
You haven't even heard from him?
Yeah.  I guess.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
I don't want to make friends.
What, like it's that hard?
No.  I'm scared.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
OK.
I'm not so bad.
Truly.
Should we explore?
Where's the money hid.
My mother?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
I wish I knew.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
I see a car.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
I mean is it... is it...?
Radio said.
It's fine.
I don't think it's negative five.
I wear a seven.
Who wouldn't.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
The hell I can't.
It's our goddamn car!
No. It's her brother.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Well...sorry...
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
It's a surprise.
Two million.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
I'll walk back.
Good thing you didn't.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
So long.
Nobody asked you to.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Yeah..
Listen to me I --
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Listen to me I --
I ain't in a hurry.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Let's get a hot dog.
You still in love?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I know.
Right behind you.
No, it's good to see you.
Then let us prepare.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Yes you are.
Shut up!
She can only use cash.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
You will die.
Nothin'.
I don't know.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
She's very beautiful.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Curious.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Oh, damn!
Why is that?
We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
How did you know?
Go.
She said it on her tape.
I'm cool.
Why didn't you tell me?
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Yes.
I never said you were "nothing".
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Is that OK?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
The KISS Army!
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
BREAKING OUT
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
BREAKING OUT
Come on.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Yeah, you.
YOUNG BLOOD
Let's go.
I NEED SOME
Fuck her too.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I didn't say that.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
...Just beautiful.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Okay! Jesus!
He's not going to listen to me.
With this chick.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Where?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Show her.
I SAID OKAY?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I said okay?
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
You have to tell me --
All right, darling.
I'll pay for it.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You need a new car anyway.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
You too.
Shut up.
She doesn't answer me either.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Sid, it's useless!
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Hold your breath, Dad...
I'll be long gone.
Job.
I'm going to California with my brother.
David, let's go now.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Really?
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You're right.
He's great, right. Is he great?
You've got a legitimate job.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I'm so hungry.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Because I think he's wrong.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
That shouldn't be a problem.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
We all do. Now let's go.
Where are you?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Why are you smiling so?
That I'm a freak.
That what he says. Right?
Know what?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Who me?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
BREAKING OUT
I told you what I want.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
I don't know, Cole.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Oh my God.
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
A lady. She died.
Shut up.
Ghosts.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Dead people?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
This makes five.
Bitch.
Come here a minute.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
You don't know what you want.
Out.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Yeah.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Yeah.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
But you'll do it?
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
I'll do it.
No.  What house you work?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Yeah.
Put it down!
Pretty much, yep.
Shit!
I'll be right back.
Mine?
Better.
I knew you would come.
I love you, too.
EXCUSE ME?
Was she right?
A lady. She died.
No.  I love you.
You haven't even heard from him?
You must have been dreaming.
Can't leave the desk.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Front.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Claire...!
No.
Let's do it.
Yes.
"To"... Forget about you.
He's a fucking maniac!
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Yeah, I do.
Just putting in an appearance then.
I don't care.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Will you sign the register, please?
I'll be right up.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Did you hear what I said?!!
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Did you hear what I said?
You give me hope, John.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Maybe.
No. No, that's okay.
"King Kong". It's really good.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
But your face did!
What if you get hurt?
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
What?
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
I hadn't planned on it.
Okay.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Oh, I believe it.
You're the faggot.
Who do you think I am?
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Right.  Will you help us?
BLAME...
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
I am busy inside.
Of course.
Yeah.
Was I doing something to your neck?
Somebody stole it.
I... do not want this...
Would you shut up?
There's a few of us left.
You met her.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Aye, sir.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Make it so.
You get the girl.
Understood.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
There is that.
That was two hours ago.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Do as I tell you!
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Yes.
We'll all go crazy...
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Do you mean that?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
I want to try it.
Trust me...
Goodbye.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I am your friend.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Yes. Sing some more.
No.  I don't.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
...hundred yards further down the road.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Well, good luck with the job.
You promised.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
No.
Do you like it when he asks you?
No.  It didn't.
Do it!
Are you going to make me beg?
I won't.
What's wrong with me?
I'm trying to.
He had an orange hat on.
Yes, sir.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Oh.
No. It's her brother.
What's going on?
Who says something's on my mind.
...you might get cut out.
A wolf.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
When he was seventeen.
I'll be around.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
What the fuck are you doing?
...get the hell outta here already...
Take your hands off me!
...well, it suits you...
Apple core?
Go for it, man.
You gonna miss your bus.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
What say we flip for it?
Sure.
She's up for it.
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
Well here I am.
You gotta do it.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
You've met her?
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Always.
Can you make it back?
True.
Okay! Jesus!
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Back from where?
Get rid of them...
He left!
I love you.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Tell me you love me.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Is it true?
I can't.
Did you speak to my father?
Goodbye.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
But do you mean it?
Marge, you like everybody.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
I don't like you.
That's a long story...
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Not really. Maybe a little.
Have you done something to your hair?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Not right now.
I can explain.
Please.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Is he coming back here?
It's all true.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Or I could come back.
Stop!
I give up.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Nah.  I suppose not.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Sure.
What's your real name?
I think you do.
Oh, come off it, man.
What happened to the baby?
Do they drug you?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
Okay.  Fine.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
But other people can see them too.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
I love you too, man.
You don't have to.
Don't swear.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
He wanted more than that.
What do you mean?
You gotta keep going.
Iris?
What?
I'm here to see Iris.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Yes.  You'll be outside.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I did?  Huh!
Yes sir!
I do?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Be right with you.
I'm  fine.  Really.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Of course.
Charlie!
Oh.
Fuck this.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
You will die.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Is that all there is?
Then go.
No. No thank you.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I...
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Maybe.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
I'm sure.
You are?!
Seven o'clock then.
What yard? When who-
His wife changed the channel.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
How about you?
Pity.
You must be exhausted.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
Why don't you do it then?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
How do you know?
I was wrong.
Yes I do, I really do.
What is it?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What did I say?
My door is always open.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
You're my brave boy.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Just take it.
Well, sure, but--
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
She's still alive?
I'm not going to marry anybody.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
Don't worry, I can.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
I'd give you a very good price.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Of course.
I better get cleaned up, then.
Right.  Will you help us?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Believe me I know.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
No.  That's stupid.
Maybe.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
I'll get him.
Then we'll never make it.
Then it's still no.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Are you scared?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Trust me...
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Trust me...
Damn right I do.
Not here... alone.  Please.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
All right...
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Jackie.
It's coming.
You're not crazy.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
So it's helping?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Have you always been a waitress?
You too.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
I'll pay for it.
That sounds nice.
Yeah.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
I wish it were that easy...
Front.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Am I in trouble?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Put your shoulders back.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
I don't wanna go.
Well, you got it now.
Well, I'll see ya.
Yup.
Two million.
You're crazy.
Shit.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
What?
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Way up ahead!
I NEED SOME
Go?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Go.
A pizza?!
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Something I heard someone say once.
Well once. Mary.
You promise?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Well, I'll see ya.
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
He's no Steve Young.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Okay.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
Well.  Well...
I mean is it... is it...?
I will go and wake them up!
And on to a bigger one with you?
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
How so?
I gotta go.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why, what's gonna happen?
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Yesterday.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
I like to play "reality".
Yes, sir.
That's up to you.
I have expectations, too.
Off me or off you?
Let's do it.
Yes sir!
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Is it you?
I might not stay, anyway.
Oh...I'll think of something.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
I know. I was there.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Tell me!
Where do I sign?
You bet.
Heck, no!  What?!
That's right.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
I want you.
He's a good man.
I want you to kill for me.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
God damn, you people are confusing.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
She is.  Don't go in there.
The pages are gone. That's real.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Maybe.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Let's go all the way.
Exactly.
When am I going to see you?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
James...
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Everything, but everything.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Oh, Laura.
It's a long way to go for a date.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
Not really.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
You stay away from him!
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
I want to go home.
That's right.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Norma, are you alright?
Is anything wrong?
Yes.
You ready?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Thank you.
Yes... I... yes.
Oh.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
He's busy being dead.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I mean it.
That's for sure, Frank.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Yeah.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
I just saw her.
Were you drinking?
In New York?
Thank you.
What?
Don't give me that bullshit.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Yeah.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
The cheese...
And I...I've got other things happening.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Yeah, sure.
I can't tell.
I am about this.
Yeah.
Anonymous.
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Look, I just better go.
David, let's go now.
I just brought you something to eat.
Good.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Why are you here?
I'll do that.
About anything.
Yeah, hurry up though.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
My eyes are open.
I'm goin'.
No.
That'd be good, Lula.
You're your own baby.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Yeah, I did.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Not yet, Jeff.
Put your shoulders back.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
What?
Get in.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Yeah.  I guess.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
The bus station.
Don't say a .
Just checking.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Fuck you.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I wear a seven.
That... and you.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
True.
I said it didn't sound like you.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
It didn't come up.
You're not a bitch.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
Let's go all the way.
Early July.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Well... not in the common way.
That's a damn long time...
If you could, you would have brought one today.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Doesn't everybody?
Rats?
I could get a search warrant.
I've done that before.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Where we going?
Do you like it when he asks you?
I don't believe you.
Yes you can, Robin.
... We could try that.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes. Unfair to me.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Now. We close now.
Will I see you again?
So did you
It's getting dark. Go home.
St. Joseph's.
I don't know!
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
I want you to calm down.
Some kinds of women are...
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
I feel... okay.
You heard me. Where is it?
Yeah, you.
Of course.
They're all assholes.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
I have to leave now.
Since you've had sex?
Thank you.
Maybe you should be.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
That's not what I meant.
Look at me...
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Mom, it's ...
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Your father is proud of you.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's good.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
Goodbye, Daddy.
But then when will we see each other?
Sure.
I deserve it.
It's killing me.
I don't love you.
Oh, Rick!
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
And how come you're up so early?
Okay, fine. Sure
Yes.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I don't know.
I said, I ain't got you...
Anything... may I sit down?
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
I don't know.
I mean it.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
I had a baby.
Get against the wall!
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Of course.
Why isn't anyone coming?
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
No... don't hit me please...
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Uh huh.
There is no big job.
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
What job?
The sheets...
What.
What sheets?
It's not that, I just...
I'd love one.
Shut up.  West's dead.
My God, but you're determined.
Do they drug you?
What happened to the baby?
No, you're not.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Well ...
Yeah.
Down the ... er ...
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Right.  Talk to you.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
I'm trying.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Thanks for the thought.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Can you see anything?
Okay, Sandy.
Let's get moving with this net.
That's right.
I believe I will.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
When are you coming home?
That's nice.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
That's what matters, isn't it?
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
What's his name?
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Dad, come in.
It's not that, I just...
Yes, slowly.
Come on!
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
Strip?
Okay.  But not water sports.
Would you shut up?
I don't hear anything.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Night!
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Yeah?
Please?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Oh.  You're them.
Is that all there is?
Excuse me?
I mean it.
We've heard lots about you.
Save it for your wife.
Oh yeah?
Come on.
Are you always this much fun?
That's the problem.
For good.
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
I mean, you're really back.
Then why do it?
I'll be your best friend.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Let's just go home, okay?
What?
How long ago was it?
The beach?  It was nice.
I...
Dead.
No, no thanks.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Let me help you.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Pick a card.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
I don't want it.
Then I'll get caught.
Of course not.
Do you?
Mind if I come in?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Okay?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You didn't?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
It's okay. It's okay.
What's this -- you packing?
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
No, don't say anything else!
Still stuck on her, huh.
Every night.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Save it.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
A lady. She died.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
Well ...
God knows.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
What is it?
What else?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words, about why we kill.
How about you?
It's a spring day...
Railroad tickets.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Got any easier questions?
I know, you want go for a ride.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Yes... It's true.
What?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Mexico.
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
The beach?  It was nice.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Fine.
No Marty, I don't.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Because, I'll take it.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
Both.
You got into Harvard Law?
Why?  I don't know.
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Let me guess, Russia came up?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
I'm going to California with my brother.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
I said, I ain't got you...
Sure I'm sure!
What?
Alright!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Fuck you!
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
You will wish you hadn't.
Only one arm?
You may use my office.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I'll need to make a phone call.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
Yeah.
One more. Maybe two --
Why?
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Everything went to his head.
I do.
Ours, Ed.
About a job.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
-- I like the car I have.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
You sleeping with her?
I love you.
-- Obviously.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Don't you?
Yeah, what?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Right... Right.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
I don't want to come here anymore.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I have expectations, too.
I'm worried about someone.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Fuck off.
That's good.
A toast to the end of the world.
Good.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Curious... Very curious....
Oh, yes.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
This makes five.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Get out of the fucking car.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
I mean it.
I love you, Vanessa.
Cause I can't allow it.
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
It's your play.
I can paint anywhere.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
She walked.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Yes.
OK.
Yes.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Come where?
Hold on
How can anyone be that naive?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
You gotta keep going.
Were you drinking?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
I didn't care about the money.
Did you go home with him?
Mom?
I quit.
Here's your money.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Can you?  I couldn't.
Please.
That's a long story...
To see if I can get away with it.
No.
Why take the risk?
I don't know. Oh.
Come over here and tell me no.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Somethin', though.
Work.  Going to work.
Yeah..
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Why?
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
Junior!
I think I could do that alone.
You must be mad.
You're your own baby.
Bye.
A present I picked up for you.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Yes and no...
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Yes.
I wish I knew.
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
He sure did.
What?! I can't hear you!
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
What say we flip for it?
If I'd known you were alive --
The small one.
Yes --
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
Don't swear.
... We could try that.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
... Hmmm?
Oh, I forgot.
Life is just... too awful.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Thanks.
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
What happened?
Fine. He's very nice.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Really? Really!!!
Can I buy you another drink?
... Are you sure you like it?
Who told you to do that?
Yes, I do, it's very good.
No. Myers is taking me.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
I'll be right back.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
You change partners, you change the rules.
Of course. I would like to look.
Bitch!
I said - try again.
Why, yes.  Why?
Sid, it's useless!
Have a nice day.
It's not that, I just...
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
She is.  Don't go in there.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Mr. Gardiner...
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
We?
Why?
Me and John.
Sure.
Don't forget me.
What ten thousand pounds?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
How does an island sound to you?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Tell me you love me.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Different.
Do you?
I hadn't planned on it.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Oh Christ. Julia...
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
That's right.
Say the Word!
That's good.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I gotta go.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
You ready?
Thank you.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Well, good luck with the job.
Mom, it's ...
What yard? When who-
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Thank you, Donny.
Okay.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
BLAME...
He didn't. Get over it.
Then fuck it!!!
But, he could've --
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
--shit!!!
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
I just gotta see a guy.
Perfect.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
I'm playing to win.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Fourteen hundred.
...Hell.
I'm goin'.
Well now you do.
The State Police.
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
That's amazing.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
You're an idiot.
But why not?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Yeah...
Are you going to graduate school?
...What kind of fish?
Yeah. Call him.
I don't know, didn't he call?
She.
Pour that back.
Because she'll scare them away.
What.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Don't throw that out.
Oh... I got something for that.
Yeah.
Take care.
Then, shut up!
You heard me. Where is it?
Yes, but.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
I'll go then.
Seven o'clock then.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Yeah.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Alright.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
What?  Where is she?
I sure don't hate you.
Edward Bloom.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
You sleeping with her?
You look beautiful to me.
The small one.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Mexico.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
On a ride.
Yeah?
Good, let's drink up.
Good.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I remember you.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
See ya tomorrow.
Outside!
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Please?
No.
What? Is there someone else?
Just a minute.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
NO.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Let's wait for some slow one.
I suppose you have...
Go ahead!
Yes she is.
Alright.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
I love you too, man.
Be careful.
Barbara.
What do you mean?
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
I know...
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Good.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
What about him?
Nobody's gonna kill you.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Thank you.
Turn left ahead.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
Let's try #2.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
I don't know. I want it to be --
We stopped seeing each other.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Why?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
No.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes. Thank you.
And she left shortly after that?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Yes.
No, it's not.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
Now what?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
Well, I'm sold.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
I want to know why .
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Better than one.
It didn't get there from me.
You're your own baby.
Come here a minute.
You promised.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
Who did he leave with?
What were your parents like?
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
No.
She's a little sad, is all.
Okay.
Pile in.
How the hell should I know?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Thanks.
Then fuck it!!!
What do you mean by that?
Your father.  He was your father.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
I manage them.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
You don't need a key.
Ours, Ed.
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
SHHH!  Don't do that!
The money!
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Give it to me.
That's what matters, isn't it?
What are you, drunk?
Sal's alive???
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
All right, Caesar.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
What did he want?
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Right.  Will you help us?
Shut up, Violet.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Of course.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Could I see it?
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
A beer.  Of course.
Deep, real deep.
So am I.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
To let it dry.
I can get it. I can just...
What?
Say the Word!
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I think he's talking to it.
I'm here, aren't I?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
I think everything is okay.
I'm gettin' there
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
This ain't no photo.
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
I have expectations, too.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Nice.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Right! Right!
Jack ...
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Well, terrorists of course.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
No.
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
What name is he using?
Next of kin!
I mean it.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
What! Shit!
Of course --
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Honey?
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Sorry, Miss.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Hang on a second.
It's coming.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Backup?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
That's amazing.
Good.
Please.
No!!!!!
What? Why am I bad?
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
We sure did.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
"In her dream"?
You talked me into it.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
It's not.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Okay.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Okay.
Thank you.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
How'd he die?
That's not it.
Sorry, babe.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
They did not!
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Fuck her too.
He made a cat.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
Why, you look beautiful.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
I would have done the same thing.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
...Tonight!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
I mean it.
Like it had to be done.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
It's not that, I just...
Water.  Okay.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
That's the problem.
Merrick...
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Let them fight.
Oh.  Good.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Thank you very much.
But --
Yes, sir.
Run.
Perfect.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Good.
Hit me in the chest with this...
What?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Hold on a second.
I'll think about it.
Oh, no, please, please.
You and Candy...?
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Hello.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Fine.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
...hundred yards further down the road.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Why?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Nick?
I don't know. I want it to be --
Well...
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Okay.
Oh. That.
See you, Ginger.
Oh.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Don't you threaten me!
I don't wanna go.
Don't you threaten me!
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
James...
Let me in the house! Fucker!
I lied. Wait for it...
There was nothing to it.  It was my pleasure.
Look at me...
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
You get time off to sleep.
That's amazing.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
I have to take the car.
We can't help him if -
I don't know.
Artie! Artie!
Never mind.
Okay, Sammy.
Hold your breath, Dad...
Bye.
All right.
Everything went to his head.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Hell. It's been four days!
Sure did.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Yes.
Here, take my jacket.
I'm always here for you.
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
All right.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
So are we.
Hi.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Okay.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
My mother?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
More, I hope.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
What do they need her for?
I won't let anybody take you.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
I'm trying to.
You mean I won't resist them.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Nobody can do anything right but you!
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Nice.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Maybe.
...Thank you.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Jack ...
What's his name?
But I'm here to help you...
I wonder.
Yeah. Call him.
Must be.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Whiskey.
Which?
Yes.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
No.
Say them.
Shouldn't I go?
Careful...
That's good...
That's exactly what you said last week.
Like you're concerned.
So it's helping?
Do I?
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
Did he dance with you?
Are you scared?
Something I heard someone say once.
Sure.
No, depends on nothing.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Yeah. I care, Dil.
You'd love it!
Will you meet me again?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Yeah.
Should have stayed a girl.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Don't be cruel.
It's not.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Go look.
No.
I killed them.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show?
I can't.
No, depends on nothing.
And you're not going to tell me more?
Tom...
More than that.
Bye.
You got the keys to the shop?
Save it for your wife.
And you wouldn't leave me?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
No.
Then stay...
You promise?
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Yes.
Yes. Exactly.
You knew my Jody?
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Did you hear me?
Okay.
Don't you want to kill me?
No.
You tried.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
More what?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Can't remember...
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
You will, Dil
Like what? Your sign?
Not if you go.
You didn't?
Will I see you again?
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Aha.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
She walked.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
Good.
What?!
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Front.
Aye, I do, Peter.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
Kill me.
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
No?
I have to go.
Absolutely not.
Wait a second.
She your wife?
Who was that?
Some kinds of women are...
We're not gonna let it.
Got to catch me first --
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
How do you think I got here?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Oh.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
What for?
Who told you to do that?
Roy? It this all we have?
You did.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
-- hang on --
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Tell me!
How about once more around the park?
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
A quarter of a million dollars.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
So they think he left it with you.
Call for help.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
He left!
I'm not.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
I thought you'd be pleased.
That I'm a freak.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Yeah.
Like I told you.
You're not telling me something.
Who's it, you mean.
I'm worried about someone.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Yes. Unfair to me.
Look after yourself, Grace.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Shut up.
Go home, Sheila.
Fine.
Yeah?
Okay.
I love you, Vanessa.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
Ho, baby!
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
I...
What does that mean?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Come on, old...
My house?
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
I don't know.
...man!
No, don't. But thanks.
He's crazy!
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
Then stay...
I think we tried that. The case is over.
...here!
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Oh, no!
Of course.
No.
You didn't?
Hey, just shut up.
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Because we're going there.
Tunnel.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
No Marty, I don't.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
,
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Sorry.
I don't know.
Hold it!
You've got enough?
Us.  Owe us.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Passion.
What are you interested in?
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
only got to hold for another few days.
...you might get cut out.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its got to hold for.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Not that.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
With her mother.
Yes and no...
Where is she?
And I...I've got other things happening.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
What are you doing here?
Let me show you something.
Hey.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Gee, thanks, Lou.
A couple I know are getting married.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Shut up.
You were seeing someone, too.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
I mean I can't tell you.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Could you do anything about it?
Okay.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I'm so relieved.
Yeah.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
Apple core?
The bus station.
Somebody stole it.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
Yes.
I wish I could.
I'm going to leave you.
Life is just... too awful.
No, you're not.
Then you're a lucky man.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
He was all right.
I'll get you some coffee.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
How 'bout...
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
Save it for your wife.
I never tried it.
How's Kip?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
The money!
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
No.  Hi baby.
What?
Yes sir.
WHAT?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
No.
Making things real rough for Hal.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Cute.
The sheets...
I don't know.  I don't know.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Laugh it up.
Tell me about it.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
I'm cool.
Right.
No you don't.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Yeah...
Just drop me off.
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Yes sir!
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Who are you, Jerry?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
He was murdered.
I cannot.
Please put it down.
What did he want?
How'd he die?
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Could you be a little more specific?
Where?
What do you mean?
Well, you wanna use the shower?
It'll just take a moment.
Were you drinking?
Good luck, David.
Yeah...before your time.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yes.  I believed him.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
When he was seventeen.
Where were you?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Go and look for a note.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
What else?
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Because I think I'm wrong.
You'll get it when we get there.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Truly.
Sit down.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
So are you engaged, or what?
Exactly.
That's where I always go when I get out.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Really?
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
I think I should go home.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Are you OK?
Take a letter...
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
I think I should call someone.
Who said I...wait, what?
So, I've been thinking a lot...
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
I start on Monday.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
You're just scared.
Michael.   Yes.
No more than this?
I dunno.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
Alright.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Go look.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
It's not your fault.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
So what if I don't?
The best table in the house.
I'm buying.
Merrick...
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Not me.
For two lonely nights.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
I have to go.
Our mother can see through bags.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Is that all there is?
Reading.
Okay, I'm nuts.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I want to talk about the baby.
I want to go home.
Good. Good.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Thanks.
I'll be right there.
I'm looking for potential.
Okay.
How do you think I got here?
Call me later.
But do you mean it?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
But why not?
And I don't.
Can I buy you another drink?
It clearly is why.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
I want to fuck.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I'll do that.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Steve?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Yeah.  I guess.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Here we are.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
When I am sure I am among friends.
Did your wishes ever come true?
What's your real name?
Sometimes.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Times have changed.
Yes.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Well then ... shall we?
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
You stay out of this, Bob.
Let me be the judge of that.
Tell me!
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
Daddy, it's true.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
'Take your car?'
Never felt better.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. See ya.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
He told me what to do.
I can't help it, it smells so good.
I hadn't planned on it.
Goodnight.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
What happened?
Me neither.
What? Is there someone else?
Can you bring Mr...
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
You ready?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Can I... I brought some --
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Five million dollars.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
That was two hours ago.
How big?
Because this is a Chinese radio.
He's seriously disturbed...
Daddy...
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
WHAT?
Don't know much, do you?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Don't know that either.
Us.  Owe us.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Really?
Right.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Don't say a .
Then I love it.
The usual...
No.
Sort of... Yeah.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
Yes, sir.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Me and John.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Alan...
Always.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
That's what I want to know.
Oh.
What?
No.
I mean is it... is it...?
Home.
Perfectly.
That's okay.
When he was seventeen.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Oh.
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Then you better start swimming.
I don't know....
I'm their ride.
Do you have a check for me?
The "come back" kind.
Why?
This time, make an exception.
Where is she? Is she all right?
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Then you better start swimming.
How does an island sound to you?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Jack?  What was that?
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Hey! Come out here!
I don't know.
She fucked me too.
Tell me!
I know...
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
No women?
I guess so.
Nick's going?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
They did not!
What?
They did too!
Good-bye, Crow.
Here. Hit it here.
Good call.
You are frightened, no?
Why don't you tell me?
I have to go.
That's taking place outside now.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
No.  That's okay.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
You mean...?
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Too bad.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Get anything?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
No.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Sal's alive???
Good thing you didn't.
Oh, Jesus.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
What?
I do.
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
I see you're going hunting.
OH MY GOD!
Yeah.
Can you bring Mr...
Yeah.
Coward!
You do?
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
Will you kiss me!
That's my plan.
I don't have any money.
Great. That's great.
Ours, Ed.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Yeah.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
No.
Your mother.
Why?
Good night.
I don't want to come here anymore.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
All right, darling.
He's no Steve Young.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
The creek bed --
Yes -- at midnight.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Part of what?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
That was easy.
What's that?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Okay.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
But do you mean it?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
What?
I've done that before.
No.
That's it.
What for?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You didn't?
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
I would like to get paid now.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
That's it?
She said it on her tape.
I love you, Black.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Gotcha.
Point the gun at me!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Sorry, no further questions.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Then, go get her
I know, you want go for a ride.
Thanks.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Who says something's on my mind.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Stop!
And you are great in bed.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Everything. Just for the record.
Tomorrow, he says.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
That's their problem.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Yeah, I did.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
Does she have room for me?
Been there, done that.
Not good...
Okay.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
She's from...France.
Okay?
Good luck, David.
Where is she? Is she all right?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Okay, I'm nuts.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
Then why do it?
We're falling behind.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
No.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
From the Other Place...
Oh God. What hospital?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
St. Joseph's.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Save it.
You may use my office.
Look, we gotta talk.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
The KISS Army!
Okay, fine. Sure
We have a situation here...
You will.
You know my father?
Oh.
Kiss me.
But other people can see them too.
Oh, no.
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
I will go and wake them up!
Thanks!
What happened?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
Go! Just go!
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I look forward to seeing it.
How about White?
Not this gun!
Be careful, Danny.
Sometimes.
I'll come straight there.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
I'd be you.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
No he won't.
Are you going to make me beg?
Goddammit--
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Still drawing a blank.
Stacy--
That's fine.
You did good.
The other two will die without me.
Who?
Never mind.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Will you hang on just a second.
Bond... James Bond.
I gotta go.
Well, how's it going back there?
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
I killed them.
She can't talk to you right now.
...I...don't know.
Why?
What do you want?
In your dreams.
Oh, no!
Go fuck yourself.
No sweat.
Yeah?
You get time off to sleep.
Her or me?
I...I don't know.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
A lady. She died.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Do you?
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Can you follow simple directions?
Great.  Really.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
I know.
Let's just see how we do.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Come here -
There is no big job.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
You change partners, you change the rules.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Trust me...
Five million dollars.
Nothing.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Oh...
I would now.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Like it had to be done.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Okay.
It's not for me, it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Let's wait for some slow one.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
I want to talk about the baby.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
No. You've had your chance.
Beautiful.
I don't see anything!
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
He's a fucking maniac!
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Look!
Han's leaving?
No.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Where is she?
Only what you take with you.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
I got a new deal for you.
Bless you --
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Won't you join us?
Dinner at the White House.
What did he do to the uniform?!
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Just five or six people.
You're gettin' the car.
What man?
... power ...
Here I'll show you.
Not know.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
But your face did!
Good bye.
I'm not leaving without her.
She seemed fine.
The best part. She'll love it.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Not what.  Who.
She'll go into coma.
Somethin', though.
Yes.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
It's my goddamn car!
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
It's our goddamn car!
What?
Give me the keys.
Anybody else?
We don't need you, Frankie.
Alright.
What about tomorrow?
LET GO!
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
What's wrong with the kid?
What's going on?
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Lie down on the bed.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
He knows. He knows!
All right.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Time for what?
Never threaten me, Boss.
I wear a seven.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Home.
Save it for your wife.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Yeah.
Fire.
Well then ... shall we?
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Uh ... thanks.
He's no Steve Young.
I'll call you.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
Job.
Somebody stole it.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Fine.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
Oh, no!
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Sorry, no further questions.
I guess in case one year they're not.
I'm heading out. How about you?
So why's he do it?
I think.
No kidding?
That bad?
You sending me home?
Let's see it.
Oh.
When do the girls get to the party?
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yes.
He's losing his teeth.
Here it is.
Only one you've never broken.
Come on... get in.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
I was wrong.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
No.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Bye...
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
And you're not going to tell me more?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Aye.
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
I ain't in a hurry.
Jack...dont even start...
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
This makes five.
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Daphne, I...
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Drop that fucking money!
We just don't stop.
Oh, don't be silly.
You look like... Brian.
Oh, yah?
Shhhh.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
I guess you have.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Oh...I can't. Business.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
It's okay, Mike...
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Right, right.
We don't know. West is dead.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
We've never met.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
We'll all go crazy...
You are?!
No personal details?
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
Yes.
No.
Because, I'll take it.
Here.
The usual...
Feel anything?
Please. I can't bear it...
Nothing.
No, but I certainly shall.
You're afraid to say.
Of course not.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
...I...don't know.
Surprise me.
From the dream.
Work.  Going to work.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
Our money situation is not good.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Don't want to film this?
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
You've done pretty well.
My eyes are open.
Right.
Look at me...
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
What?
Somewhere else?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Why, you look beautiful.
I...I don't know.
John, you can't help her now.
I suppose you have...
Sorry!
Sorry, Sir.
You did.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Yes.  They're free.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I am committed. I love you.
You really want to help me?
No.
Okay...
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Yeah. How's Dad?
At being a fake.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Of course I'd like to.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
I'll be back later...
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
What?! I can't hear you!
No.
Victor.
Morning, Captain.
Nothing.
The truth.
Probably.  One of the many.
That's it.
What?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Not luck. They don't want me.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You're lucky.
Want to try it again?
Course he has. That's his wife.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Twenty years.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Sure you did.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
You've met her?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Down boy.
What's with her costume?
That's what I want to know.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
They're trying to kill me!
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
You can't do that.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Don't tell me I can't --
Yeah, come on.
I ain't -- got -- you.
I cannot.
I said, I ain't got you...
You should ask Bobby.
I said, I ain't got you...
Go and look for a note.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
No.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
You're for real?
Why?
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
What?
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
What's happening?
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
But you're not...you're not still here.
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
I don't wanna go.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Look who's talking.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
No.  What house you work?
That'd be good, Lula.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
And miss the big game?  No way.
I never said you were "nothing".
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Look, I don't want your money!
Get her to act like a human
Not so bad, today.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Right.
Tell me!
Mom?
A pizza?!
Yeah, down the ... er ...
No.
I didn't bleed.
Am I? Let's find out.
Me neither.
Does it feel comfortable?
Ours, Ed.
Does what feel comfortable?
You got a deal.
This could be it.
Of course.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Kill me.
Right here. At the door.
No he won't.
Where the hell are you?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Where is the car?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
Number five with a bullet.
They're my team.
No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Who is this?
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Oh my God oh my God...
No way. I always do my own work.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
What about you?
I'm still here, Doc.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
That bad?
Don't strain yourself.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
All right.
I mean it.
What?
Do you mean that?
Tell me what I can do.
I don't see how.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
Don't worry, I can.
Yeah.
I want to know why .
I guess we are.
Curious.
What about you?
This is a police control action..
Yeah. I got out.
Can you make it back?
Can't leave the desk.
Listen!  Hear that?
That's what matters, isn't it?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Two years.
But, he could've --
Can he trust you?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Never mind.
No. You don't.
Tomorrow morning, then?
The other two will die without me.
Sure I'm sure.
My mother?
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
No.
Anything.
It'll cost you.
Yeah.
No, you won't.
Have you done something to your hair?
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
No.
No.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
What?
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
We're not actually talking about it.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
As an idea.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Yes.
Yeah, come on.
Hey.
Isn't it obvious?
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Well.  Well...
I'm going home.
We are?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Oh.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Me too.
What if you don't close...?
Deal.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Don't hurt no one.
Fuck you.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
John: John:...my daughter...
I'm playing to win.
Tell me again.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
No.  She told me "right now."
Yes.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Alright.
You hear what I said?
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
They were friends.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Do you like them?
He sure did.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I think I should call someone.
I don't know.
Did you hear what I said?!!
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
I'll get my clothes.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
How much time is left?
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
You?
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Feel this.
I knew you'd say that, too --
What do you mean?
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Or what?
How's Kip?
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
Steve?
Come here -
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Okay.
She's coming.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I wish I knew.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Then stay...
That's important.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
Look after yourself, Grace.
I got your card.
Me and John.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Put them away.
That would be fine.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Me too.
Yes?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
That must have taken you a long time.
How about White?
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
You're all right.
No I wasn't...
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Yes you were.
Nice ... Nice ...
Pretty boring, I guess.
Maybe.
How many?
Maybe...
Then let's go have some fun.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
No.
It's good to see you, Dad.
I'll walk back.
Yeah..
Whatever I can get away with.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Got to catch me first --
I'll think about it.
Just my luck.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
It's something I do...
Won't you join us?
That's good.
If there's a train.
OK.
What.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
She's coming.
I don't care.
Yes.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
We're handling it, sir.
Night.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
Let's not talk about that now.
...What kind of fish?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Of course not.
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
I'll get a coat for her.
Yeah?
Okay, come on down.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Go get me a beer.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
Come over here and tell me no.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
What!?
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
What's the difference?
Right back where we started.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
There's over eighty thousand here.
You?
That's taking place outside now.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Shouldn't I go?
Then it's worth the journey.
Some kinds of women are...
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Thank God...
In my room.
I can't...
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
What do you mean by that?
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
We were just riding around.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Yeah.
Well...
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
It didn't get there from me.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
You will wish you hadn't.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Alright.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Somethin', though.
Oh.
What were your parents like?
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
My people love me.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
But you --
Perhaps.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
I don't know....
Yeah.
I'm just getting started....
Seven o'clock then.
No one does till they learn....
I'm sorry. It is.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Put it down!
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Why, what's gonna happen?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You need a new car anyway.
Sure.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
More, I hope.
No.
No.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Good-night.
Somewhere else?
